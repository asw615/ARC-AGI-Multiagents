          "To implement the task analysis efficiently, let's break down the components using the structured thinking process you've outlined.\n\n### 1. Core Transformation Components:\n\n#### a. Identify Main Pattern Rules:\n- **Pattern Recognition**: Identify objects and their characteristics (size, shape, color).\n- **Pattern Transformation**: Rotate, flip, or modify identified objects.\n\n#### b. List Required Tools for Each Rule:\n- **Object Identification**: Use `get_objects` to extract objects from the grid. This will help in recognizing patterns and individual elements.\n- **Object Manipulation**: Tools like `rotate_clockwise`, `horizontal_flip`, and `vertical_flip` can change the orientation of objects as required.\n- **Object Combination**: If necessary, use `combine_object` to merge objects or parts of them.\n\n#### c. Explain Tool Selection Reasoning:\n- `get_objects` provides detailed information about each object, which is essential for transformation.\n- Rotation and flip functions allow us to change object orientation, aligning with potential transformation requirements.\n- `combine_object` is crucial for scenarios where objects need to be merged post-transformation.\n\n### 2. Exception Handling:\n\n#### a. Identify Special Cases:\n- **Overlapping Objects**: When transformed objects overlap, determine if overwriting is needed.\n- **Multicolor Objects**: If objects consist of multiple colors, handle accordingly.\n\n#### b. List Tools for Edge Cases:\n- Use `combine_object` with care to manage overlapping scenarios.\n- `change_object_color` can be used to standardize or differentiate multicolor objects.\n\n#### c. Define Exception Conditions:\n- Overlapping: If transformed objects intersect, decide on precedence or merging.\n- Multicolor: If color consistency is required, convert multicolor objects to a single color.\n\n### 3. Implementation Sequence:\n\n#### a. Order of Operations:\n1. **Extract Objects**: Use `get_objects` to identify all grid objects.\n2. **Transform Objects**: Apply transformations using rotation or flip functions.\n3. **Merge/Modify**: Use `combine_object` if objects need merging post-transformation.\n\n#### b. Tool Dependencies:\n- Ensure that `get_objects` is used first to provide data for subsequent transformation tools.\n- `combine_object` should be used after transformations to manage overlaps.\n\n#### c. Critical Checkpoints:\n- Verify object extraction to ensure all elements are identified.\n- Post-transformation, ensure no data loss or unintended alterations.\n\n### 4. Validation Steps:\n\n#### a. Input Validation Requirements:\n- Ensure input grid is correctly formatted and non-empty.\n- Validate grid dimensions align with expectations.\n\n#### b. Output Verification Steps:\n- Confirm transformed objects retain their intended properties (size, orientation).\n- Check the grid for correctness in object placement and overall integrity.\n\n#### c. Error Handling Needs:\n- Handle errors in object extraction, ensuring all objects are identified.\n- Manage exceptions during transformation, especially in rotations exceeding grid boundaries.\n\n### Implementation Details:\n\n1. **Extract Objects**:\n   ```python\n   objects = get_objects(grid, more_info=True)\n   ```\n\n2. **Transform Each Object**:\n   Loop through each object and apply necessary transformations:\n   ```python\n   for obj in objects:\n       obj_grid = obj['grid']\n       transformed_grid = rotate_clockwise(obj_grid, degree=90)  # Example transformation\n       # Additional transformations as required\n   ```\n\n3. **Combine and Place Objects**:\n   If overlapping or merging is needed:\n   ```python\n   combined_object = combine_object(obj_1, obj_2)\n   ```\n\n4. **Validation**:\n   Ensure the final grid is as expected:\n   ```python\n   assert validate_grid(final_grid), \"Output grid validation failed.\"\n   ```\n\nBy following these detailed steps, you can transform the grid according to specified patterns while handling exceptions and ensuring accuracy."

Core Transformation Components\n\n#### Identify Main Pattern Rules\n- **Object Identification**: Use `get_objects` to identify objects within the grid based on color, shape, or position.\n- **Object Manipulation**: Depending on the task, manipulate objects using tools like `rotate_clockwise`, `horizontal_flip`, or `change_object_color`.\n- **Object Placement**: Place objects into a new grid or modify the existing one using `fill_object` or `fill_value`.\n\n#### Required Tools for Each Rule\n- **Identification**: `get_objects(grid, more_info=True)` to obtain object details.\n- **Manipulation**: \n  - `rotate_clockwise(grid, degree=90)` for rotation.\n  - `horizontal_flip(grid)` or `vertical_flip(grid)` for flipping.\n  - `change_object_color(obj, value)` for color changes.\n- **Placement**:\n  - `fill_object(grid, obj, align=False)` to place objects.\n  - `fill_value(grid, pos, value)` for specific cell alterations.\n\n#### Tool Selection Reasoning\n- Tools are selected based on their ability to perform the necessary transformations directly and efficiently. The choice depends on the characteristics of the objects and the desired outcome.\n\n### 2. Exception Handling\n\n#### Identify Special Cases\n- **Overlapping Objects**: Use `combine_object(obj_1, obj_2)` to handle overlapping during placement.\n- **Empty or Non-Existent Objects**: Ensure checks are in place to handle cases where no objects are found.\n\n#### Tools for Edge Cases\n- **Combining and Overlapping**: `combine_object()` to resolve overlaps.\n- **Empty Checks**: Implement conditional checks following object identification.\n\n#### Define Exception Conditions\n- If `get_objects` returns an empty list, handle scenarios where no objects are present.\n- When combining objects, handle priority rules for overlapping parts.\n\n### 3. Implementation Sequence\n\n#### Order of Operations\n1. **Grid Analysis**: Use `get_objects` to analyze and retrieve objects.\n2. **Object Transformation**: Apply necessary transformations using manipulation tools.\n3. **Grid Construction**: Modify or construct the grid using placement tools.\n\n#### Tool Dependencies\n- Ensure `get_objects` is called before any manipulation or placement, as it provides essential object data.\n- Manipulation tools might depend on prior transformations (e.g., flipping before placement).\n\n#### Critical Checkpoints\n- Post-object identification: Verify correct object detection.\n- Post-transformation: Ensure objects are transformed as expected.\n\n### 4. Validation Steps\n\n#### Input Validation Requirements\n- Validate grid dimensions and content before processing.\n- Ensure input grid contains identifiable objects.\n\n#### Output Verification Steps\n- Confirm transformed grid matches expected pattern.\n- Check that all objects are placed correctly without unintended overlaps.\n\n#### Error Handling Needs\n- Implement error messages for invalid grid inputs.\n- Use try-except blocks to catch and manage exceptions during transformations.\n\nBy following these steps, you can implement a robust and efficient transformation process tailored to the specific task requirements. Each tool is selected for its ability to address specific transformation needs, ensuring flexibility and accuracy in handling various scenarios."

          "To determine the exact transformation rules and required tools for your task, we need to break down the task into core transformation components, handle any exceptions, outline the implementation sequence, and establish validation steps. Here's a detailed plan:\n\n### 1. Core Transformation Components\n\n#### Identify Main Pattern Rules\n- **Object Extraction**: Use `get_objects()` to identify distinct objects within the grid.\n- **Object Transformation**: Depending on the task, use tools like `rotate_clockwise()`, `horizontal_flip()`, or `vertical_flip()` to transform objects.\n- **Object Combination**: Use `combine_object()` if objects need to be merged.\n- **Object Coloring**: Use `get_object_color()` and `change_object_color()` to manipulate object colors.\n- **Grid Manipulation**: Use `fill_object()`, `fill_row()`, `fill_col()`, and `fill_between_coords()` to manipulate grid elements.\n\n#### List Required Tools for Each Rule\n- **Object Extraction**: `get_objects(grid, diag=False, multicolor=False, by_row=False, by_col=False, by_color=False, more_info=True)`\n- **Object Transformation**: `rotate_clockwise(grid, degree=90)`, `horizontal_flip(grid)`, `vertical_flip(grid)`\n- **Object Combination**: `combine_object(obj_1, obj_2)`\n- **Object Coloring**: `get_object_color(obj)`, `change_object_color(obj, value)`\n- **Grid Manipulation**: `fill_object(grid, obj, align=False)`, `fill_row(grid, row_num, value, start_col=0, end_col=30)`, `fill_col(grid, col_num, value, start_row=0, end_row=30)`, `fill_between_coords(grid, coord_1, coord_2, value)`\n\n#### Explain Tool Selection Reasoning\n- **Object Extraction** is the first step to identify components to process.\n- **Transformation Tools** are chosen based on the required manipulation of objects (rotation, flipping, etc.).\n- **Combination and Coloring Tools** are used to merge objects and ensure they meet color requirements.\n- **Grid Manipulation Tools** allow modification of the grid as needed for final output.\n\n### 2. Exception Handling\n\n#### Identify Special Cases\n- **Multi-color Objects**: Handle objects that consist of multiple colors.\n- **Overlapping Objects**: Handle cases where objects overlap in the grid.\n- **Boundary Conditions**: Handle edge objects at grid boundaries.\n\n#### List Tools for Edge Cases\n- **Multi-color Handling**: `get_objects(grid, multicolor=True)`\n- **Overlapping Handling**: `combine_object(obj_1, obj_2)`\n- **Boundary Handling**: Ensure transformations respect grid limits using `crop_grid(grid, tl, br)` if necessary.\n\n#### Define Exception Conditions\n- **Multi-color Objects**: When `multicolor=True` returns true for objects.\n- **Overlapping**: When combining objects results in overlap.\n- **Boundary**: When transformations exceed grid dimensions.\n\n### 3. Implementation Sequence\n\n1. **Extract Objects**: Use `get_objects()` to get objects and their properties.\n2. **Transform Objects**: Apply transformations like `rotate_clockwise()`, `horizontal_flip()`, or `vertical_flip()`.\n3. **Color and Combine**: Adjust colors with `change_object_color()` and merge objects using `combine_object()`.\n4. **Place Objects on Grid**: Use `fill_object()` to place transformed objects back on the grid.\n5. **Final Adjustments**: Use grid manipulation tools like `fill_row()`, `fill_col()`, etc., for any final touches.\n\n#### Tool Dependencies\n- Extraction must precede transformation.\n- Transformation must be complete before placement.\n- Color adjustments should occur before final placement.\n\n#### Critical Checkpoints\n- **Before Transformation**: Ensure correct object extraction.\n- **After Transformation**: Validate object orientation.\n- **Final Placement**: Ensure grid integrity and object placement.\n\n### 4. Validation Steps\n\n#### Input Validation Requirements\n- Ensure input grid is non-empty and correctly formatted.\n\n#### Output Verification Steps\n- Confirm all expected objects are present in the output.\n- Verify that transformations are correctly applied.\n- Ensure grid dimensions and properties are maintained.\n\n#### Error Handling Needs\n- Handle cases where objects cannot be extracted or transformed.\n- Manage memory or computational limits during processing.\n\nBy following these detailed steps, you can implement the transformation rules accurately using the available tools. Adjustments may be necessary depending on specific task requirements and edge cases encountered during implementation."

Here\u2019s how you can approach it:\n\n### 1. Core Transformation Components:\n\n#### Identify Main Pattern Rules:\n- **Object Identification:** Use `get_objects()` to identify and isolate objects within a grid.\n- **Object Manipulation:** Depending on the task, you may need to rotate, flip, or change colors of these objects.\n- **Grid Modification:** Use tools to modify or fill grids based on identified objects and patterns.\n\n#### List Required Tools for Each Rule:\n- **Object Extraction:** `get_objects(grid, multicolor=True, more_info=True)` to extract all objects with detailed information.\n- **Object Analysis:** `get_pixel_coords(grid)` to get pixel distribution and coordinates.\n- **Object Manipulation:** \n  - `rotate_clockwise(grid, degree)` for rotation needs.\n  - `horizontal_flip(grid)` or `vertical_flip(grid)` for flipping needs.\n  - `change_object_color(obj, value)` for color changes.\n- **Grid Filling/Modification:** \n  - `fill_object(grid, obj, align=True)` to place objects back in the grid.\n  - `fill_rect(grid, tl, br, value)` for filling specific areas.\n\n#### Explain Tool Selection Reasoning:\n- **Comprehensive Object Handling:** `get_objects()` with `multicolor=True` and `more_info=True` provides flexibility in handling complex objects.\n- **Pixel-Level Control:** `get_pixel_coords()` facilitates fine-grained control over object manipulation.\n- **Versatile Grid Operations:** A suite of grid manipulation tools allows for precise transformation based on task needs.\n\n### 2. Exception Handling:\n\n#### Identify Special Cases:\n- **Overlapping Objects:** When objects overlap after manipulation.\n- **Color Conflicts:** When color changes result in conflicts.\n- **Boundary Conditions:** Objects that touch grid edges.\n\n#### List Tools for Edge Cases:\n- **Combine Objects:** `combine_object(obj_1, obj_2)` to handle overlap by allowing one object to overwrite another.\n- **Boundary Check:** Ensure manipulations do not exceed grid dimensions.\n\n#### Define Exception Conditions:\n- **Overlap Resolution:** Use `combine_object()` strategically to resolve overlaps by deciding precedence.\n- **Color Conflict Resolution:** Ensure unique colors post-transformation or handle with `change_object_color()`.\n\n### 3. Implementation Sequence:\n\n#### Order of Operations:\n1. **Extract Objects:** Use `get_objects()` to get all objects.\n2. **Analyze and Plan:** Use `get_pixel_coords()` to understand object distribution and plan transformations.\n3. **Manipulate Objects:** Apply necessary transformations (rotation, flip, color change) using appropriate tools.\n4. **Place/Fill Objects:** Use `fill_object()` or `fill_rect()` to update the grid.\n5. **Handle Exceptions:** Check for overlaps or color conflicts and resolve using `combine_object()` and color tools.\n\n#### Tool Dependencies:\n- Ensure objects are extracted before manipulation.\n- Manipulations may depend on analysis (e.g., coordinate checks).\n\n#### Critical Checkpoints:\n- Post extraction, verify object count and properties.\n- After manipulation, check alignment and overlaps.\n\n### 4. Validation Steps:\n\n#### Input Validation Requirements:\n- Ensure grid is non-empty and correctly formatted.\n- Verify tool parameters are within expected ranges (e.g., rotation degrees).\n\n#### Output Verification Steps:\n- Check that all objects are correctly transformed and placed.\n- Validate grid dimensions and data integrity post-transformation.\n\n#### Error Handling Needs:\n- Implement checks for invalid grid manipulations (e.g., out-of-bound errors).\n- Ensure robust handling of unexpected object configurations.\n\nBy following these detailed implementation steps and utilizing the appropriate tools, you can effectively transform the grid as required by the task analysis."

Explain Tool Selection Reasoning\n- The selection of `get_objects` and `get_pixel_coords` is driven by the need for accurate object and color identification.\n- Transformation tools like `rotate_clockwise` are essential for orientation changes, which are often required in grid tasks.\n- Color tools ensure that transformations don't alter required color properties unless specified.\n\n### 2. Exception Handling\n\n#### a. Identify Special Cases\n- **Objects with identical properties**: Ensure that similar objects are treated correctly and not merged unless required.\n- **Boundary Conditions**: Handle objects at grid edges with care to avoid clipping issues.\n\n#### b. List Tools for Edge Cases\n- **Boundary Checks**: Use `crop_grid` and `tight_fit` to manage objects at boundaries.\n- **Color Consistency**: Use `object_contains_color` to verify color presence before and after transformations.\n\n#### c. Define Exception Conditions\n- Objects that span across boundaries should be cropped or fitted appropriately to avoid loss of information.\n- Color transformations should not alter the intended design unless explicitly mentioned.\n\n### 3. Implementation Sequence\n\n#### a. Order of Operations\n1. **Extract Objects**: Use `get_objects` to identify and extract objects from the grid.\n2. **Analyze Colors**: Use `get_pixel_coords` to determine color distributions.\n3. **Transform Objects**: Apply necessary transformations using `rotate_clockwise`, `horizontal_flip`, etc.\n4. **Reintegrate Objects**: Use `combine_object` to place transformed objects back into the grid.\n\n#### b. Tool Dependencies\n- `get_objects` must be called before any transformation to ensure correct object targeting.\n- Transformation tools depend on object extraction to identify which segments to alter.\n\n#### c. Critical Checkpoints\n- Post-extraction, verify that all objects are correctly identified.\n- After transformations, ensure objects maintain their essential properties.\n\n### 4. Validation Steps\n\n#### a. Input Validation Requirements\n- Ensure the grid is non-empty and correctly formatted.\n- Validate that object extraction returns expected results.\n\n#### b. Output Verification Steps\n- Verify transformed objects against expected patterns.\n- Confirm that no unintended color or shape alterations occurred.\n\n#### c. Error Handling Needs\n- Handle empty grids gracefully by returning an empty result or appropriate message.\n- Provide feedback on failed transformations due to incorrect tool usage or parameters.\n\nBy following these structured steps and selecting the appropriate tools, you can achieve the desired transformations while handling exceptions and validating both inputs and outputs effectively."

          "To determine the exact transformation rules and required tools for the given task, we'll break down the process into the following key components: Core Transformation Components, Exception Handling, Implementation Sequence, and Validation Steps.\n\n### 1. Core Transformation Components:\n\n#### **Identify Main Pattern Rules:**\n- **Object Extraction:** Identify and extract objects within the grid using `get_objects()`.\n- **Object Manipulation:** Transform objects using tools like `rotate_clockwise`, `horizontal_flip`, `vertical_flip` as needed.\n- **Object Combination:** If necessary, combine objects using `combine_object`.\n- **Object Placement:** Place objects back into the grid using `fill_object`.\n\n#### **List Required Tools for Each Rule:**\n- **For Object Extraction:** \n  - `get_objects(grid, multicolor=True, more_info=True)`: To identify objects, especially those with multiple colors.\n- **For Object Manipulation:**\n  - `rotate_clockwise(grid, degree)`: Rotate objects to desired orientation.\n  - `horizontal_flip(grid)`, `vertical_flip(grid)`: Flip objects if symmetry or a mirrored pattern is needed.\n- **For Object Combination:**\n  - `combine_object(obj_1, obj_2)`: Merge objects where necessary, handling overlaps.\n- **For Object Placement:**\n  - `fill_object(grid, obj, align=True)`: Place objects back in the grid, aligning if necessary.\n\n#### **Explain Tool Selection Reasoning:**\n- **Object Dynamics:** `get_objects()` allows for precise capture of object characteristics, which is crucial for any transformation.\n- **Functional Transformations:** Rotation and flipping tools provide essential transformations needed for aligning or modifying objects.\n- **Seamless Integration:** `fill_object()` and `combine_object()` ensure that manipulated objects are integrated back into the grid accurately.\n\n### 2. Exception Handling:\n\n#### **Identify Special Cases:**\n- **Single-Color Objects:** May need alternative handling if the task requires transformations based on color.\n- **Overlapping Objects:** Address how to handle overlapping scenarios during object combination.\n\n#### **List Tools for Edge Cases:**\n- **Color Handling:** `get_object_color(obj)` and `change_object_color(obj, value)` for special color-based rules.\n- **Overlapping Management:** `combine_object()` ensures objects are merged correctly, with overwriting rules defined.\n\n#### **Define Exception Conditions:**\n- **Empty or Null Grids:** Ensure grids are not empty before processing.\n- **Unexpected Object Shapes:** Handle cases where object extraction doesn\u2019t yield expected results.\n\n### 3. Implementation Sequence:\n\n#### **Order of Operations:**\n1. **Extract Objects:** Use `get_objects()` to retrieve all relevant objects from the grid.\n2. **Transform Objects:** Apply necessary rotations, flips, or color changes.\n3. **Combine Objects:** If multiple objects need to be merged, use `combine_object()`.\n4. **Place Objects:** Use `fill_object()` to position the transformed objects back into the grid.\n\n#### **Tool Dependencies:**\n- Extraction must precede manipulation and placement.\n- Combine operations depend on the availability of already transformed objects.\n\n#### **Critical Checkpoints:**\n- Verify object extraction results before proceeding.\n- Confirm transformations achieve desired visual patterns.\n\n### 4. Validation Steps:\n\n#### **Input Validation Requirements:**\n- Ensure input grid is valid and non-empty.\n- Confirm object extraction yields non-zero objects.\n\n#### **Output Verification Steps:**\n- Validate that objects are placed correctly in the grid.\n- Check that object transformations match expected outcomes.\n\n#### **Error Handling Needs:**\n- Handle cases with unexpected or zero objects gracefully.\n- Output meaningful errors for invalid operations or transformations.\n\nBy following the outlined approach, you ensure that the task is executed efficiently, with attention to detail and robustness in handling various scenarios."

          "To determine the exact transformation rules and required tools for the task, we need to break down the problem into its components and map them to the available tools. Here's how we can approach this:\n\n### 1. Core Transformation Components\n\n**Step 1: Identify Objects in the Grid**\n- **Tool:** `get_objects(grid, more_info=True)`\n- **Reasoning:** This tool allows us to identify distinct objects within the grid, providing details such as their top-left coordinates, grid representation, size, cell count, and shape.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze Object Properties**\n- **Tool:** `get_object_color(obj)`\n- **Reasoning:** To determine the color of each object, which may be crucial for transformations that depend on color properties.\n\n**Step 3: Modify Object Properties or Positions**\n- **Tool:** `change_object_color(obj, value)`\n- **Reasoning:** If transformations involve changing an object's color.\n- **Tool:** `rotate_clockwise(grid, degree=90)`\n- **Reasoning:** For transformations that require rotating objects.\n- **Tool:** `horizontal_flip(grid)` / `vertical_flip(grid)`\n- **Reasoning:** Used for flipping objects horizontally or vertically.\n\n**Step 4: Combine or Reorganize Objects**\n- **Tool:** `combine_object(obj_1, obj_2)`\n- **Reasoning:** If the task involves merging objects, ensuring that the second object overwrites the first in case of overlaps.\n\n### 2. Exception Handling\n\n**Special Case 1: Overlapping Objects**\n- **Condition:** When two objects overlap and need to be combined.\n- **Tool:** `combine_object(obj_1, obj_2)`\n\n**Special Case 2: Objects with Multiple Colors**\n- **Condition:** If an object consists of multiple colors.\n- **Tool:** `get_objects(grid, multicolor=True, more_info=True)`\n\n**Special Case 3: Empty or Minimal Grids**\n- **Condition:** If the grid is empty or contains very few elements.\n- **Tool:** `empty_grid(row, col)`\n\n### 3. Implementation Sequence\n\n1. **Extract Objects:**\n   - Use `get_objects(grid, more_info=True)` to identify and extract all objects from the grid.\n   \n2. **Analyze and Modify Objects:**\n   - For each object, determine its color using `get_object_color(obj)`.\n   - Apply necessary transformations like `rotate_clockwise`, `horizontal_flip`, or `vertical_flip` based on task requirements.\n\n3. **Combine or Fill Objects:**\n   - If objects need to be merged, use `combine_object(obj_1, obj_2)`.\n   - If objects need to be placed in specific positions, use `fill_object(grid, obj, align=False)`.\n\n4. **Final Adjustments:**\n   - Ensure the grid maintains its integrity by filling any necessary spaces or adjusting object positions.\n\n### 4. Validation Steps\n\n**Input Validation:**\n- Ensure the input grid is correctly formatted and contains recognizable elements for processing.\n\n**Output Verification:**\n- Check that transformed objects meet the specified task requirements in terms of position, color, and orientation.\n- Validate that the final grid structure is correct and contains no unexpected elements.\n\n**Error Handling:**\n- Implement checks for cases like empty grids or missing objects.\n- Ensure transformations do not lead to unintended overlaps or loss of data.\n\nBy following this structured approach, we can effectively transform the grid according to the detailed task analysis using the specified tools. Each step is mapped to specific tools, ensuring clarity and precision in the implementation process."

          "To determine the exact transformation rules and required tools based on the task analysis, we need to follow a structured approach. Here is a detailed breakdown:\n\n### 1. Core Transformation Components\n\n**Identify Main Pattern Rules:**\n- Determine the primary transformations needed on the grid (e.g., object extraction, object manipulation, grid filling).\n- Identify if the task involves object extraction, rotation, resizing, color manipulation, or any specific pattern recognition.\n\n**List Required Tools for Each Rule:**\n- **Object Extraction:** Use `get_objects()` to identify and extract objects from the grid.\n- **Rotation and Flipping:** If objects need rotation or orientation adjustment, use `rotate_clockwise()`, `horizontal_flip()`, or `vertical_flip()`.\n- **Color Manipulation:** Use `get_object_color()` to determine the current color and `change_object_color()` to modify it.\n- **Grid Filling:** Use `fill_object()`, `fill_row()`, `fill_col()`, or `fill_rect()` to populate sections of the grid.\n\n**Explain Tool Selection Reasoning:**\n- The choice of tools is based on their ability to manipulate grid structures or object properties effectively. For example, `get_objects()` is essential for isolating components for transformation.\n\n### 2. Exception Handling\n\n**Identify Special Cases:**\n- Consider grids with multiple objects, overlapping objects, or unique color patterns.\n- Handle empty grids or grids with no identifiable objects.\n\n**List Tools for Edge Cases:**\n- **Empty Grid Handling:** Use `empty_grid()` to create a baseline grid if needed.\n- **Overlapping Objects:** Use `combine_object()` to manage overlapping scenarios.\n\n**Define Exception Conditions:**\n- If `get_objects()` returns an empty list, it indicates no objects are present.\n- Handle cases where object properties like size or color do not match expected criteria.\n\n### 3. Implementation Sequence\n\n**Order of Operations:**\n1. **Extract Objects:** Use `get_objects()` to isolate components.\n2. **Transform Objects:** Apply necessary transformations like rotation or flipping.\n3. **Color Adjustments:** Use `get_object_color()` and `change_object_color()` if color changes are required.\n4. **Grid Manipulation:** Reintegrate modified objects into the main grid using appropriate filling functions.\n\n**Tool Dependencies:**\n- Ensure transformations are applied in sequence, e.g., color changes before grid filling.\n\n**Critical Checkpoints:**\n- Validate object extraction before proceeding with transformations.\n- Confirm color changes and grid integrity at each step.\n\n### 4. Validation Steps\n\n**Input Validation Requirements:**\n- Ensure input grids are non-empty and contain valid data structures.\n- Verify that objects extracted meet the size and shape requirements for transformations.\n\n**Output Verification Steps:**\n- Check that transformed objects are correctly placed and oriented within the grid.\n- Confirm that color changes are accurately applied.\n\n**Error Handling Needs:**\n- Implement error messages for invalid grid sizes or unrecognized patterns.\n- Use try-except blocks to catch and handle exceptions during transformations.\n\n### Specific, Actionable Implementation Details\n\n1. **Extract Objects:**\n   ```python\n   objects = get_objects(grid, multicolor=True, more_info=True)\n   ```\n\n2. **Transform Objects:**\n   - Rotate or flip if needed:\n     ```python\n     for obj in objects:\n         obj_grid = rotate_clockwise(obj['grid'], degree=90)\n         obj_grid = horizontal_flip(obj_grid)\n     ```\n\n3. **Change Colors:**\n   ```python\n   for obj in objects:\n       color = get_object_color(obj)\n       if color != desired_color:\n           change_object_color(obj, desired_color)\n   ```\n\n4. **Fill Grid:**\n   ```python\n   for obj in objects:\n       fill_object(grid, obj, align=True)\n   ```\n\n5. **Validate and Handle Exceptions:**\n   - Ensure all objects are processed.\n   - Handle scenarios where no transformations are applicable.\n\nBy following these steps, you can effectively transform the grid as required by the task analysis, ensuring both accuracy and efficiency in the process."

List Required Tools for Each Rule:**\n   - **Object Identification:** Use `get_objects()` to parse the grid and identify separate objects.\n   - **Grid Manipulation:** Use tools like `rotate_clockwise()`, `horizontal_flip()`, and `vertical_flip()` for spatial transformations.\n   - **Color Manipulation:** Utilize `get_object_color()` and `change_object_color()` to manage color-specific transformations.\n   - **Grid Filling:** Employ `fill_object()`, `fill_row()`, `fill_col()`, and `fill_rect()` for populating specific areas.\n\n**1.3. Explain Tool Selection Reasoning:**\n   - **Selection Logic:** Tools are chosen based on the specific task requirements like identifying patterns, manipulating spatial orientation, and modifying colors.\n   - **Efficiency:** Choose tools that offer the most direct means of achieving the task objectives, minimizing complex sequences.\n\n### 2. Exception Handling\n\n**2.1. Identify Special Cases:**\n   - **Single-Color Objects:** If the task involves single-color objects, ensure multicolor is set to `False` in `get_objects()`.\n   - **Edge Boundaries:** Handle grid boundaries to avoid index errors during transformations.\n\n**2.2. List Tools for Edge Cases:**\n   - **Boundary Handling:** Use `tight_fit()` to manage excess empty rows/columns.\n   - **Color Verification:** Use `object_contains_color()` to handle color-specific exceptions.\n\n**2.3. Define Exception Conditions:**\n   - **Empty Grids:** Ensure that transformations do not proceed on empty grids.\n   - **Non-Overlapping Objects:** Manage object overlap using `combine_object()`.\n\n### 3. Implementation Sequence\n\n**3.1. Order of Operations:**\n   - **Step 1:** Identify and extract objects using `get_objects()`.\n   - **Step 2:** Perform necessary transformations (rotation, color change) on each object.\n   - **Step 3:** Reintegrate objects into the grid using placement and filling tools.\n\n**3.2. Tool Dependencies:**\n   - Ensure object extraction is performed before any manipulation.\n   - Use filling tools after transformations to ensure correct placement.\n\n**3.3. Critical Checkpoints:**\n   - Verify object extraction accuracy.\n   - Confirm transformations align with task goals before applying changes to the grid.\n\n### 4. Validation Steps\n\n**4.1. Input Validation Requirements:**\n   - Confirm grid is correctly formatted and contains valid data types.\n   - Ensure object extraction parameters match task requirements.\n\n**4.2. Output Verification Steps:**\n   - Check that the transformed grid meets the specified pattern rules.\n   - Validate that all objects are correctly positioned and colored post-transformation.\n\n**4.3. Error Handling Needs:**\n   - Implement error messages for invalid input formats.\n   - Use try-except blocks to manage unexpected tool behavior.\n\n### Implementation Details\n\n1. **Start by extracting objects:**\n   ```python\n   objects = get_objects(grid, diag=False, multicolor=True, more_info=True)\n   ```\n\n2. **Apply transformations:**\n   - Rotate objects if required:\n     ```python\n     for obj in objects:\n         obj_grid = rotate_clockwise(obj['grid'], degree=90)\n         # Further manipulation if needed\n     ```\n\n3. **Reintegrate into the grid:**\n   - Use `fill_object()` or `fill_value()` to place objects back into the grid.\n   - Handle overlapping using `combine_object()`.\n\n4. **Validate the final output:**\n   - Ensure the grid meets the task's pattern requirements.\n   - Check for any errors or discrepancies in the final output configuration.\n\nBy following this structured approach, the task can be implemented efficiently with clear transformation rules and appropriate tool utilization."

          "To determine the exact transformation rules and required tools, we'll break down the task analysis into four key components: core transformation components, exception handling, implementation sequence, and validation steps.\n\n### 1. Core Transformation Components\n\n#### Identify Main Pattern Rules\n- **Object Identification:** Use `get_objects()` to identify objects within the grid. This function helps in segmenting the grid into distinct objects based on specified criteria, such as color or position.\n  \n- **Object Manipulation:** Depending on the transformation requirements, you may need to rotate, flip, or change the color of these objects. Tools such as `rotate_clockwise()`, `horizontal_flip()`, `vertical_flip()`, and `change_object_color()` will be essential.\n  \n- **Object Placement:** For repositioning objects, functions like `fill_object()` and `combine_object()` are useful. They allow you to place objects in specific locations or combine them without overlap issues.\n\n#### List Required Tools for Each Rule\n- **Segmentation:** `get_objects()`\n- **Transformation:** `rotate_clockwise()`, `horizontal_flip()`, `vertical_flip()`\n- **Color Manipulation:** `change_object_color()`\n- **Placement:** `fill_object()`, `combine_object()`\n\n#### Explain Tool Selection Reasoning\n- `get_objects()` is selected for its ability to extract and provide detailed information about objects, which is necessary for most grid manipulations.\n- Transformation tools like `rotate_clockwise()` and flips are crucial for altering the orientation of objects.\n- `change_object_color()` allows for color-based transformations, which might be required if the task involves color adjustments.\n- `fill_object()` and `combine_object()` are chosen for precise placement and combination of objects within the grid.\n\n### 2. Exception Handling\n\n#### Identify Special Cases\n- **Overlapping Objects:** When combining objects, overlap might occur.\n- **Empty or Non-standard Grid Configurations:** Cases where the grid is completely empty or has non-standard patterns.\n\n#### List Tools for Edge Cases\n- **Overlap Handling:** `combine_object()` inherently manages overlaps by allowing `obj_2` to overwrite `obj_1`.\n- **Empty Grid Management:** `empty_grid()` can be used to create a baseline grid in scenarios where the input is empty or malformed.\n\n#### Define Exception Conditions\n- If `get_objects()` returns an empty list, handle this by either exiting the process or establishing a default action (e.g., creating a default object).\n- Ensure that when transforming objects, the resulting grid remains within acceptable bounds.\n\n### 3. Implementation Sequence\n\n#### Order of Operations\n1. **Extract Objects:** Use `get_objects()` to identify and extract all relevant objects from the grid.\n2. **Transform Objects:** Apply necessary transformations (rotation, flipping) using the respective tools.\n3. **Color Adjustment:** Change object colors if required.\n4. **Positioning:** Use `fill_object()` or `combine_object()` to place transformed objects back into the grid.\n\n#### Tool Dependencies\n- Ensure `get_objects()` is called before any transformation, as it provides the initial data needed.\n- Apply transformations and color changes sequentially to avoid conflicts.\n\n#### Critical Checkpoints\n- Confirm successful extraction of objects.\n- Validate transformations by comparing dimensions and expected outcomes.\n- Ensure objects fit within the grid bounds post-transformation.\n\n### 4. Validation Steps\n\n#### Input Validation Requirements\n- Check if the grid is non-empty and of expected dimensions.\n- Validate that objects have been correctly identified and extracted.\n\n#### Output Verification Steps\n- Verify that the transformed grid matches expected output configurations.\n- Check for any unintentional overlap or misplacement of objects.\n\n#### Error Handling Needs\n- Implement error handling for invalid inputs or unexpected states (e.g., malformed grids).\n- Use try-except blocks to catch and log errors during transformation processes.\n\nBy following this detailed plan, you will be able to systematically implement the transformations required for the task, leveraging the available tools effectively while handling exceptions and validating outcomes."

          "To implement the task transformation, we'll follow a structured approach based on the core components, exception handling, implementation sequence, and validation steps. Here's a detailed breakdown:\n\n### 1. Core Transformation Components:\n\n#### Identify Main Pattern Rules:\n- **Object Extraction:** Identify and extract objects from the grid based on specific characteristics (e.g., by color, by row).\n- **Object Manipulation:** Perform transformations like rotation, flipping, or color change on extracted objects.\n- **Object Placement:** Place transformed objects back into the grid in a specific pattern or order.\n\n#### List Required Tools for Each Rule:\n- **Object Extraction:**\n  - `get_objects(grid, by_color=True, multicolor=True, more_info=True)`: To segment the grid into distinct objects based on color.\n  \n- **Object Manipulation:**\n  - `rotate_clockwise(grid, degree=90)`: To rotate objects as required.\n  - `horizontal_flip(grid)`: To flip objects horizontally.\n  - `vertical_flip(grid)`: To flip objects vertically.\n  - `change_object_color(obj, value)`: To change the color of objects.\n  \n- **Object Placement:**\n  - `fill_object(grid, obj, align=False)`: To place objects back into the grid.\n\n#### Explain Tool Selection Reasoning:\n- **Extraction Tools:** `get_objects` is versatile for extracting objects based on different criteria, allowing flexibility in defining what constitutes an object in the grid.\n- **Manipulation Tools:** Rotation and flipping tools are essential for altering the orientation and appearance of objects, which might be necessary for pattern matching or alignment.\n- **Placement Tools:** `fill_object` allows for precise placement of objects back into the grid, maintaining their integrity.\n\n### 2. Exception Handling:\n\n#### Identify Special Cases:\n- Objects that overlap when placed back into the grid.\n- Objects that need to be combined or modified based on specific conditions.\n\n#### List Tools for Edge Cases:\n- **Overlapping Objects:** `combine_object(obj_1, obj_2)` to handle overlap by ensuring the desired object overwrites another.\n- **Grid Boundary Check:** Ensure placement does not exceed grid bounds, potentially using `tight_fit` to adjust object sizes.\n\n#### Define Exception Conditions:\n- If objects overlap and need combining.\n- If objects extend beyond grid boundaries after transformation.\n\n### 3. Implementation Sequence:\n\n#### Order of Operations:\n1. **Extract Objects:** Use `get_objects` to identify objects.\n2. **Transform Objects:** Apply necessary transformations (rotation, flipping, color change).\n3. **Combine Objects:** Use `combine_object` if overlapping occurs.\n4. **Place Objects:** Use `fill_object` to place objects back into the grid.\n\n#### Tool Dependencies:\n- Object extraction must precede manipulation and placement.\n- Ensure transformed objects fit within grid dimensions before placement.\n\n#### Critical Checkpoints:\n- Verify successful extraction of objects.\n- Check transformations are applied correctly.\n- Confirm objects are placed without exceeding grid dimensions.\n\n### 4. Validation Steps:\n\n#### Input Validation Requirements:\n- Ensure input grid is valid and non-empty.\n- Validate extracted objects meet transformation criteria.\n\n#### Output Verification Steps:\n- Verify final grid matches expected pattern or state.\n- Ensure no unintended overlaps or boundary violations.\n\n#### Error Handling Needs:\n- Handle cases where objects cannot be extracted due to non-standard grid configurations.\n- Manage errors in transformation steps, such as incorrect rotations or flips.\n\nBy following these detailed steps, we ensure a comprehensive approach to grid transformation, addressing core operations, exceptions, and validation requirements."

Core Transformation Components\n\n#### Identify Main Pattern Rules\n- **Identify Objects:** Use `get_objects()` to identify objects within the grid. This includes options for distinguishing by rows, columns, and colors based on the required transformation.\n- **Transform Objects:** Depending on the task, transformations might include rotation, flipping, or changing colors.\n- **Placement of Objects:** Use operations like filling rows, columns, or specific coordinates to place transformed objects.\n\n#### List Required Tools for Each Rule\n- **Object Identification:** `get_objects()`\n- **Object Manipulation:**\n  - Rotation: `rotate_clockwise()`\n  - Flipping: `horizontal_flip()`, `vertical_flip()`\n  - Color Change: `change_object_color()`\n- **Object Placement:** `fill_object()`, `fill_row()`, `fill_col()`, `fill_between_coords()`\n\n#### Explain Tool Selection Reasoning\n- **get_objects():** Needed to extract identifiable parts of the grid for further processing.\n- **Rotation and Flipping:** Offer spatial transformations to match required patterns.\n- **Color Change:** Adapts object color to meet task specifications.\n- **Filling and Placement:** Ensures objects are correctly positioned within the grid.\n\n### 2. Exception Handling\n\n#### Identify Special Cases\n- Overlapping objects\n- Objects with negative space or empty cells\n\n#### List Tools for Edge Cases\n- **Overlapping Objects:** `combine_object()` to merge overlapping objects.\n- **Handling Empty Cells:** `tight_fit()` and `replace()` to manage empty spaces and ensure tight object borders.\n\n#### Define Exception Conditions\n- **Overlap Detection:** When two objects share grid space.\n- **Empty Space Handling:** When an object has internal empty cells that need ignoring or filling.\n\n### 3. Implementation Sequence\n\n#### Order of Operations\n1. **Object Detection:** Use `get_objects()` to identify all relevant objects.\n2. **Transformation:** Apply necessary rotational or flipping transformations.\n3. **Color Adjustment:** Use `change_object_color()` if color changes are needed.\n4. **Placement:** Use appropriate filling tools to position transformed objects.\n\n#### Tool Dependencies\n- **Object Detection** is foundational; transformations depend on detected objects.\n- **Color and Placement** adjustments depend on the transformed state of objects.\n\n#### Critical Checkpoints\n- Correct identification and transformation of objects.\n- Verify object properties (like size and color) before placement.\n\n### 4.

Here's how we can break it down:\n\n### 1. Core Transformation Components\n\n#### Identify Main Pattern Rules\n- Identify objects within the grid.\n- Determine transformation types (e.g., rotation, flipping, color changes).\n- Analyze object relationships (e.g., overlap, adjacency).\n\n#### List Required Tools for Each Rule\n- **Object Identification**: `get_objects` with appropriate parameters based on whether objects are distinguished by color, row, or column.\n- **Transformation Operations**: \n  - `rotate_clockwise` for rotation transformations.\n  - `horizontal_flip` and `vertical_flip` for flipping transformations.\n  - `change_object_color` for changing object colors.\n- **Object Manipulation**: \n  - `combine_object` to overlay or combine objects.\n  - `fill_object` to place objects back onto the grid.\n- **Utility Operations**:\n  - `tight_fit` to remove empty space around objects.\n  - `replace` for pattern replacements within a grid.\n  \n#### Explain Tool Selection Reasoning\n- Tools are selected based on their ability to modify grid structures and properties of objects within them. They provide granular control over transformations required for the task.\n\n### 2. Exception Handling\n\n#### Identify Special Cases\n- Overlapping objects after transformations.\n- Objects that change size after rotation or flipping.\n- Color conflicts when combining objects.\n\n#### List Tools for Edge Cases\n- **Overlaps**: `combine_object` can handle object overlaps by prioritizing one object's pixels.\n- **Color Conflicts**: `object_contains_color` can be used to check color conflicts before combining.\n- **Size Changes**: `tight_fit` ensures objects are correctly sized before further processing.\n\n#### Define Exception Conditions\n- If `combine_object` results in a loss of important features, adjust parameters or transformation sequence.\n- Use `tight_fit` to ensure no unnecessary space is included around objects.\n\n### 3. Implementation Sequence\n\n#### Order of Operations\n1. Identify all objects using `get_objects`.\n2. Apply transformations like `rotate_clockwise`, `horizontal_flip`, or `vertical_flip` as needed.\n3. Change object colors if required using `change_object_color`.\n4. Use `tight_fit` to adjust object size after transformations.\n5. Combine or overlay objects using `combine_object`.\n6. Place transformed objects back into the main grid using `fill_object`.\n\n#### Tool Dependencies\n- `get_objects` must be applied first to identify what needs to be manipulated.\n- Transformation tools (`rotate_clockwise`, etc.) depend on successful object identification.\n- `combine_object` and `fill_object` are used after transformations are complete.\n\n#### Critical Checkpoints\n- Ensure objects are correctly identified with `get_objects`.\n- Verify transformations are applied as intended.\n- Check for overlaps or conflicts before final placement.\n\n### 4. Validation Steps\n\n#### Input Validation Requirements\n- Verify grid dimensions and content before processing.\n- Ensure object detection parameters in `get_objects` match the grid's configuration.\n\n#### Output Verification Steps\n- Confirm that all intended transformations are visible in the output grid.\n- Check for unintended overlaps or missing objects.\n\n#### Error Handling Needs\n- Log transformation steps for debugging.\n- Implement checks to ensure transformations do not exceed grid bounds.\n- Use fallback strategies if a transformation fails (e.g., revert to original orientation).\n\nBy following these structured steps, you can implement transformations on grid-based tasks using the provided tools effectively."

Core Transformation Components\n\n#### Identify Main Pattern Rules:\n- **Extract and handle objects**: Use `get_objects` to identify and manipulate distinct objects within the grid.\n- **Grid Manipulations**: Tools such as `rotate_clockwise`, `horizontal_flip`, `vertical_flip`, and `crop_grid` help in transforming the grid as per the identified rules.\n- **Color Operations**: Use `get_object_color` and `change_object_color` to manipulate colors within objects.\n- **Combining and Filling**: Use `combine_object`, `fill_object`, `fill_row`, `fill_col`, and `fill_rect` for addressing specific pattern filling tasks.\n\n#### List Required Tools for Each Rule:\n- **Object Extraction**: `get_objects` with appropriate parameters to extract necessary objects.\n- **Object Manipulation**: `rotate_clockwise`, `horizontal_flip`, and `vertical_flip` for altering object orientation.\n- **Grid Construction**: `empty_grid` and `fill_object` to create and populate new grids.\n- **Color Management**: `get_object_color` and `change_object_color` to adjust object colors if needed.\n\n#### Explain Tool Selection Reasoning:\n- **Multi-utility tools**: `get_objects` is versatile for object extraction with its different parameter settings.\n- **Efficiency**: Tools like `rotate_clockwise` and `horizontal_flip` provide quick transformations without manual recalculations.\n- **Precision**: Methods like `fill_rect` and `fill_col` allow targeted filling operations that are crucial for precise grid transformations.\n\n### 2. Exception Handling\n\n#### Identify Special Cases:\n- **Overlapping Objects**: Situations where objects might overlap require handling with `combine_object`.\n- **Empty Grids**: Ensure operations can handle grids with no objects or entirely blank sections.\n- **Color Conflicts**: Objects sharing color values might require specific identification and separation logic.\n\n#### List Tools for Edge Cases:\n- **Combining Logic**: `combine_object` to resolve overlaps.\n- **Dynamic Extraction**: `get_objects` with `multicolor` and `by_color` options to handle complex color scenarios.\n\n#### Define Exception Conditions:\n- **Object Overlap**: Use `combine_object` when multiple objects may occupy the same grid space.\n- **Color Uniqueness**: Ensure unique handling when objects with similar colors are extracted together.\n\n### 3.

          "To provide specific and actionable implementation details, let's follow the structured approach outlined in the thinking section. This will help us determine the transformation rules and the required tools for implementing the task based on the task analysis provided.\n\n### 1. Core Transformation Components\n\n#### Identify Main Pattern Rules\n- **Object Retrieval**: We need to identify objects within the grid. This involves retrieving objects based on specific criteria like color or shape.\n- **Object Manipulation**: Once objects are identified, they may need to be transformed, such as rotating, flipping, or changing colors.\n- **Grid Modification**: After manipulating objects, the grid may need to be updated to reflect these changes, such as filling specific areas or replacing patterns.\n\n#### List Required Tools for Each Rule\n- **Object Retrieval**: \n  - `get_objects(grid, ...)` to extract objects from the grid with specific parameters based on task requirements.\n- **Object Manipulation**:\n  - `rotate_clockwise(grid, degree)` for rotating objects.\n  - `horizontal_flip(grid)` or `vertical_flip(grid)` for flipping objects.\n  - `change_object_color(obj, value)` for changing the color of an object.\n- **Grid Modification**:\n  - `fill_object(grid, obj, align)` to place the manipulated object back into the grid.\n  - `replace(grid, pattern1, pattern2)` to swap patterns within the grid.\n\n#### Explain Tool Selection Reasoning\n- **`get_objects`** is chosen to identify and extract objects because it allows filtering based on multiple criteria like color, which is essential for targeted transformations.\n- **Transformation tools** like rotation and flipping are critical for changing object orientation.\n- **Color manipulation tools** are necessary when task requirements involve altering the color of objects.\n- **Grid modification tools** are used to ensure that the transformed objects are correctly placed back into the grid or that specific patterns are replaced.\n\n### 2. Exception Handling\n\n#### Identify Special Cases\n- Objects might overlap or be multicolored.\n- Some transformations may not yield visible changes (e.g., rotating a symmetric shape by 180 degrees).\n\n#### List Tools for Edge Cases\n- **`combine_object(obj_1, obj_2)`**: Useful when dealing with overlapping objects.\n- **`tight_fit(grid)`**: To handle scenarios where empty space needs to be minimized.\n\n#### Define Exception Conditions\n- Objects that overlap after transformation.\n- Invalid transformations (e.g., trying to rotate non-square objects by 90 degrees).\n\n### 3. Implementation Sequence\n\n#### Order of Operations\n1. **Object Retrieval**: Use `get_objects` to extract objects based on task-specific criteria.\n2. **Object Manipulation**: Apply transformations (rotate, flip, color change) to each object.\n3. **Grid Modification**: Place transformed objects back into the grid and make any additional pattern replacements.\n\n#### Tool Dependencies\n- `get_objects` depends on the grid being in the correct state to accurately retrieve objects.\n- Transformation tools depend on the correct identification of objects.\n- Grid modification tools depend on the successful transformation of objects.\n\n#### Critical Checkpoints\n- Ensure that objects are correctly identified and extracted.\n- Confirm that transformations are applied as intended.\n- Validate that the grid is updated accurately with the transformed objects.\n\n### 4. Validation Steps\n\n#### Input Validation Requirements\n- Ensure the grid is non-empty and correctly formatted.\n- Verify parameters for tools (e.g., rotation degrees are valid).\n\n#### Output Verification Steps\n- Compare the transformed grid against expected outcomes.\n- Check that all objects are correctly placed without unintended overlaps or omissions.\n\n#### Error Handling Needs\n- Handle cases where object extraction fails.\n- Manage invalid transformation parameters gracefully.\n- Provide feedback if the grid cannot be updated as expected.\n\nBy following this structured plan, you can systematically implement the required transformations, handle exceptions, and validate outcomes effectively."

          "To determine the exact transformation rules and required tools for a given task, we need to break down the task analysis into four main components: core transformation components, exception handling, implementation sequence, and validation steps. Here\u2019s a structured approach to address each component:\n\n### 1. Core Transformation Components\n\n#### Identify Main Pattern Rules\n- **Rule Identification**: Understand the patterns or transformations that need to be applied to the grid. This could involve identifying objects, rotating them, changing colors, or filling specific grid areas.\n\n#### List Required Tools for Each Rule\n- **Object Identification**: Use `get_objects()` to detect objects in the grid. Parameters can be adjusted based on whether the objects are multicolored, need to be separated by rows/columns, etc.\n- **Pixel Analysis**: Utilize `get_pixel_coords()` to obtain a detailed mapping of pixel placements and their frequencies.\n- **Grid Manipulation**: \n  - Use `rotate_clockwise()` for rotation tasks.\n  - Use `horizontal_flip()` or `vertical_flip()` for flipping tasks.\n  - Use `fill_value()` or `fill_rect()` for specific filling operations.\n- **Object Manipulation**:\n  - Use `change_object_color()` to modify an object's color.\n  - Use `combine_object()` if two objects need to be merged.\n\n#### Explain Tool Selection Reasoning\n- Tools are selected based on their ability to perform specific transformations efficiently. For example, `get_objects()` is essential for identifying discrete elements within a grid, which can then be manipulated using rotation or color change tools.\n\n### 2. Exception Handling\n\n#### Identify Special Cases\n- **Multi-layer Objects**: If objects overlap, ensure the combination logic (e.g., `combine_object()`) handles this correctly.\n- **Color Ambiguity**: When objects are multicolored, ensure color changes are applied correctly.\n\n#### List Tools for Edge Cases\n- Use `tight_fit()` to handle grids where objects may be sparse or irregularly shaped.\n- Use `object_contains_color()` to verify color presence in ambiguous cases.\n\n#### Define Exception Conditions\n- Conditions like overlapping objects, ambiguous object detection, or incomplete color changes need to be addressed with conditional logic or additional tool usage.\n\n### 3. Implementation Sequence\n\n#### Order of Operations\n1. **Object Detection**: Use `get_objects()` to identify objects.\n2. **Transformation Application**:\n   - Rotate or flip as needed using `rotate_clockwise()`, `horizontal_flip()`, or `vertical_flip()`.\n   - Change object colors using `change_object_color()`.\n3. **Placement and Merging**: Position objects using `fill_object()` and merge as necessary with `combine_object()`.\n\n#### Tool Dependencies\n- Ensure `get_objects()` is run before any manipulation tools since it provides the base object data.\n- `rotate_clockwise()` and `horizontal_flip()` depend on the grid or object being identified first.\n\n#### Critical Checkpoints\n- After each transformation, verify the grid state to ensure expected changes have occurred before proceeding.\n\n### 4. Validation Steps\n\n#### Input Validation Requirements\n- Ensure the grid conforms to expected dimensions and contains identifiable objects.\n- Validate that all objects have been correctly identified and categorized.\n\n#### Output Verification Steps\n- Compare the final grid with expected outcomes manually or using automated checks to ensure transformations are applied correctly.\n- Verify object positioning and color changes against task requirements.\n\n#### Error Handling Needs\n- Implement try-catch blocks or equivalent error handling around key operations to manage unexpected input or tool failures.\n- Log errors for analysis and debugging.\n\nBy following these structured steps, you can effectively implement a grid transformation task using the specified tools, while managing exceptions and validating results."

          "To determine the exact transformation rules and required tools, we'll break down the task analysis into the core transformation components, exception handling, implementation sequence, and validation steps.\n\n### Core Transformation Components\n\n1. **Identify Main Pattern Rules:**\n   - **Object Identification:** We need to identify objects within a grid. Use `get_objects()` to retrieve these objects. The parameters `diag`, `multicolor`, `by_row`, `by_col`, and `by_color` can be adjusted based on the specific task requirements.\n   - **Coordinate Extraction:** Use `get_pixel_coords()` to understand the distribution of pixel values and their locations, which helps in analyzing the grid structure.\n   - **Transformation Operations:** Depending on the task, transformations could include rotating, flipping, or combining objects. Tools such as `rotate_clockwise()`, `horizontal_flip()`, and `combine_object()` are used here.\n   - **Color and Filling Operations:** Adjust object colors using `change_object_color()` and fill grids or specific areas with `fill_object()`, `fill_row()`, `fill_col()`, `fill_rect()`, and `fill_value()`.\n\n2. **Required Tools for Each Rule:**\n   - **get_objects():** To identify and extract objects from the grid.\n   - **get_pixel_coords():** To analyze pixel distribution and positions.\n   - **rotate_clockwise(), horizontal_flip(), vertical_flip():** For modifying the orientation of objects.\n   - **change_object_color():** For color transformations of objects.\n   - **fill_object(), fill_row(), fill_col(), fill_rect(), fill_value():** For filling operations on the grid.\n\n3. **Tool Selection Reasoning:**\n   - The choice of tools is based on the need to manipulate and analyze grid structures and objects within them. The tools offer flexibility in managing object orientation, color, and placement according to the task specifications.\n\n### Exception Handling\n\n1. **Identify Special Cases:**\n   - **Empty Grids or Objects:** Handle cases where no objects are detected or the grid is empty.\n   - **Overlapping Objects:** Use `combine_object()` carefully to address overlapping scenarios.\n   - **Color Conflicts:** Ensure color transformations do not lead to unintended overlaps or visual artifacts.\n\n2. **Tools for Edge Cases:**\n   - **empty_grid():** Create blank grids to handle cases with no initial objects.\n   - **tight_fit():** Remove unnecessary empty space for more precise operations.\n   - **object_contains_color():** Check for specific colors within objects to avoid conflicts.\n\n3. **Define Exception Conditions:**\n   - Define conditions such as grid bounds, object existence, and allowable color changes to handle edge cases effectively.\n\n### Implementation Sequence\n\n1. **Order of Operations:**\n   - **Step 1:** Use `get_objects()` to extract all objects from the grid.\n   - **Step 2:** Analyze objects with `get_pixel_coords()` to determine their placement and characteristics.\n   - **Step 3:** Apply necessary transformations (rotate, flip) using respective tools.\n   - **Step 4:** Modify colors using `change_object_color()` if needed.\n   - **Step 5:** Place objects back onto the grid using filling functions as required.\n\n2. **Tool Dependencies:**\n   - Ensure that object extraction is done before any transformation or color change.\n   - Adjust grid dimensions before filling operations using `tight_fit()` if necessary.\n\n3. **Critical Checkpoints:**\n   - Validate object extraction results.\n   - Confirm transformation correctness.\n   - Verify color changes and final grid composition.\n\n### Validation Steps\n\n1. **Input Validation Requirements:**\n   - Check grid dimensions and ensure valid input data.\n   - Validate parameter values for functions (e.g., rotation degrees).\n\n2. **Output Verification Steps:**\n   - Confirm that all objects are correctly transformed and placed back onto the grid.\n   - Ensure that the final grid meets task specifications in terms of layout and color.\n\n3. **Error Handling Needs:**\n   - Implement try-catch blocks to handle unexpected errors during object extraction and transformation.\n   - Log errors for further analysis and debugging if necessary.\n\nBy following these detailed steps, you can implement a comprehensive solution for transforming grids and handling objects according to specified task requirements."

Let's delve into each component:\n\n### 1. Core Transformation Components\n\n**Identify Main Pattern Rules:**\n- **Object Extraction:** Use `get_objects` to identify and extract objects from the grid. This provides detailed information about each object, including their position and dimensions.\n- **Object Manipulation:** Depending on the task, manipulate objects using transformations such as rotation (`rotate_clockwise`), flipping (`horizontal_flip`, `vertical_flip`), or resizing (`tight_fit`).\n- **Object Combination:** If objects need to be combined, use `combine_object` to merge them, ensuring the second object overwrites the first in case of overlap.\n- **Color Manipulation:** Change object colors using `change_object_color` if specific color transformations are needed.\n\n**List Required Tools for Each Rule:**\n- **Extraction:** `get_objects`\n- **Transformation:** `rotate_clockwise`, `horizontal_flip`, `vertical_flip`\n- **Combination:** `combine_object`\n- **Color Change:** `change_object_color`\n\n**Explain Tool Selection Reasoning:**\n- These tools are selected because they directly address the possible transformations needed for objects in a grid-based task, providing flexibility to manipulate objects' orientation, size, and color.\n\n### 2. Exception Handling\n\n**Identify Special Cases:**\n- **Empty Grids:** Handle scenarios where the grid might be empty or objects are not present.\n- **Overlapping Objects:** Consider how objects should interact when they overlap during transformations or combinations.\n\n**List Tools for Edge Cases:**\n- **Empty Grids:** `empty_grid` to create a placeholder or handle absence of objects.\n- **Overlapping Objects:** `combine_object` ensures correct overlay behavior.\n\n**Define Exception Conditions:**\n- **Empty Grids:** Verify with `get_objects` if no objects are returned.\n- **Overlapping Objects:** Ensure the correct object is intended to overwrite another.\n\n### 3. Implementation Sequence\n\n**Order of Operations:**\n1. **Initialize and Extract:** Start with extracting objects using `get_objects`.\n2. **Transform Objects:** Apply necessary transformations using rotation and flipping tools.\n3. **Combine Objects:** Use `combine_object` if merging is required.\n4. **Apply Color Changes:** Use `change_object_color` if the task requires it.\n\n**Tool Dependencies:**\n- Object transformations depend on successful extraction with `get_objects`.\n- Color changes depend on knowing the object details first.\n\n**Critical Checkpoints:**\n- After extraction, validate the object list and their properties.\n- Post-transformation, ensure objects maintain expected orientation and dimensions.\n\n### 4. Validation Steps\n\n**Input Validation Requirements:**\n- Ensure the grid is a valid 2D list.\n- Verify object extraction returns non-empty results unless the grid is empty.\n\n**Output Verification Steps:**\n- Confirm transformed objects match the expected patterns or orientations.\n- Check combined objects for correct overlay and positioning.\n\n**Error Handling Needs:**\n- Handle invalid inputs by raising exceptions or returning error messages.\n- Implement checks after each transformation step to ensure operations are successful.\n\nBy following this structured approach, we can systematically transform grid-based data using the outlined tools, while being prepared to handle any exceptions or special cases that may arise. This ensures robust and accurate implementation of the task requirements."

Core Transformation Components\n\n**Objective:** Determine the transformation rules and identify the necessary tools for each rule.\n\n#### Identify Main Pattern Rules:\n- **Object Detection:** Use `get_objects()` to identify distinct objects within the grid. This tool allows for the specification of criteria such as multicolor objects, objects grouped by row or column, etc.\n- **Object Manipulation:** Tools like `rotate_clockwise()`, `horizontal_flip()`, and `vertical_flip()` can be used to change the orientation of objects.\n- **Object Coloring:** Use `change_object_color()` to modify the color of objects if the transformation requires color changes.\n- **Object Placement:** Use `fill_object()` to place or align objects within a grid.\n\n#### Required Tools:\n- **For Detection:** `get_objects()`\n- **For Manipulation:** `rotate_clockwise()`, `horizontal_flip()`, `vertical_flip()`\n- **For Coloring:** `change_object_color()`\n- **For Placement:** `fill_object()`\n\n#### Tool Selection Reasoning:\n- **get_objects()** provides a comprehensive breakdown of objects which is essential for any transformation.\n- **Manipulation tools** (rotate, flip) are needed if the transformation involves changing the orientation of detected objects.\n- **Coloring tools** ensure that objects can be modified to the desired colors.\n- **Placement tools** allow for precise positioning of objects within the grid.\n\n### 2. Exception Handling\n\nIdentify potential edge cases and define how to handle them.\n\n#### Special Cases:\n- **Overlapping Objects:** Adjustments may be needed if objects overlap after transformation.\n- **Boundary Conditions:** Ensure objects don\u2019t exceed grid boundaries after transformations.\n\n#### Tools for Edge Cases:\n- **combine_object()**: To handle overlapping objects by specifying which object should take precedence.\n- **tight_fit()**: To remove empty rows/columns that might result from transformations.\n\n#### Exception Conditions:\n- Use boundary checks before applying transformations to avoid overflow.\n- When combining objects, ensure that the precedence rules are clearly defined.\n\n### 3. Implementation Sequence\n\nOrder the operations to maximize efficiency and ensure dependencies are respected.\n\n#### Order of Operations:\n1. **Detect Objects:** Use `get_objects()` to extract objects from the grid.\n2. **Process Objects:** Apply any necessary transformations (rotation, flipping).\n3. **Color Adjustments:** Change colors using `change_object_color()` if needed.\n4. **Placement:** Use `fill_object()` to place objects back into the grid.\n5. **Handle Overlaps/Boundaries:** Use `combine_object()` and `tight_fit()` as needed.\n\n#### Tool Dependencies:\n- Ensure `get_objects()` is run before any manipulation.\n- Use `tight_fit()` after transformations to clean up the grid.\n\n#### Critical Checkpoints:\n- After object detection, verify the correct number of objects is identified.\n- Post-transformation, check orientation and color accuracy.\n- Confirm objects fit within the grid bounds after placement.\n\n### 4. Validation Steps\n\nEstablish clear validation criteria to ensure the transformation is correct.\n\n#### Input Validation Requirements:\n- Validate grid dimensions and content before processing.\n- Ensure tool parameters are correctly set (e.g., `degree` in `rotate_clockwise()` is among [90, 180, 270]).\n\n#### Output Verification Steps:\n- Verify the transformed grid against expected outcomes using predefined test cases.\n- Check that object positions and attributes (color, orientation) match the desired state.\n\n#### Error Handling Needs:\n- Implement error messages for invalid operations (e.g., rotation degree out of range).\n- Ensure graceful handling of empty or invalid grids.\n\nBy following these detailed steps, the transformation process can be executed systematically, ensuring robustness and accuracy in handling grids and objects."

Core Transformation Components\n\n#### Pattern Rules and Required Tools\n\n1. **Object Identification:** \n   - **Tool:** `get_objects(grid, more_info=True)`\n   - **Reasoning:** This tool helps identify and extract objects from the grid, providing detailed information such as size, cell count, and shape, which are essential for further processing.\n\n2. **Object Manipulation:**\n   - **Rotation and Flipping:**\n     - **Tools:** `rotate_clockwise(grid, degree)`, `horizontal_flip(grid)`, `vertical_flip(grid)`\n     - **Reasoning:** These tools are used if the transformation requires changing the orientation of an object in the grid.\n   - **Color Change:**\n     - **Tool:** `change_object_color(obj, value)`\n     - **Reasoning:** Use this tool if the task involves changing the color of identified objects.\n\n3. **Grid Manipulation:**\n   - **Cropping and Fitting:**\n     - **Tools:** `crop_grid(grid, tl, br)`, `tight_fit(grid)`\n     - **Reasoning:** These are useful for resizing the grid to focus on specific areas or remove empty spaces.\n   - **Combining Objects:**\n     - **Tool:** `combine_object(obj_1, obj_2)`\n     - **Reasoning:** This is necessary if the transformation involves merging multiple objects.\n\n4. **Filling and Replacement:**\n   - **Filling:**\n     - **Tools:** `fill_object(grid, obj, align)`, `fill_rect(grid, tl, br, value)`, `fill_row(grid, row_num, value)`, `fill_col(grid, col_num, value)`\n     - **Reasoning:** These are used to fill parts of the grid with specific values or objects, based on the transformation rules.\n   - **Pattern Replacement:**\n     - **Tool:** `replace(grid, pattern1, pattern2)`\n     - **Reasoning:** This is used if there is a need to replace specific patterns within the grid.\n\n### 2. Exception Handling\n\n#### Identifying Special Cases and Tools\n\n- **Empty Objects:**\n  - **Condition:** If an object is identified as empty or has no significant features.\n  - **Tool:** `tight_fit(grid)` to ensure no empty spaces are considered part of an object.\n\n- **Overlapping Objects:**\n  - **Condition:** When objects overlap and need to be merged.\n  - **Tool:** `combine_object(obj_1, obj_2)` to handle overlaps by defining which object takes precedence.\n\n- **Color-Specific Handling:**\n  - **Condition:** When transformations depend on specific colors.\n  - **Tools:** `object_contains_color(obj, value)`, `get_object_color(obj)` for color-specific operations.\n\n### 3. Implementation Sequence\n\n1. **Initial Setup:**\n   - Use `get_objects(grid, more_info=True)` to identify all objects.\n   - Validate input grid dimensions and properties.\n\n2. **Process Identified Objects:**\n   - For each object, determine if rotation or flipping is needed and apply using `rotate_clockwise` or flip tools.\n   - Change colors if specified using `change_object_color`.\n\n3. **Grid Modifications:**\n   - Use `tight_fit` or `crop_grid` to adjust grid size and focus.\n   - Handle any object merging with `combine_object`.\n\n4. **Final Grid Filling and Checks:**\n   - Fill necessary areas with `fill_object`, `fill_row`, `fill_col`, or `fill_rect`.\n   - Use `replace` for any pattern transformations.\n\n### 4. Validation Steps\n\n- **Input Validation:**\n  - Check grid is non-empty and contains valid objects.\n  - Ensure objects are correctly identified and extracted.\n\n- **Output Verification:**\n  - Confirm all transformations applied correctly by comparing final grid state to expected results.\n  - Verify no unintended alterations occurred, especially in color or shape.\n\n- **Error Handling:**\n  - Implement checks for invalid operations (e.g., out-of-bounds errors in grid manipulation).\n  - Ensure graceful handling of empty or null objects.\n\nBy following this structured approach, you can effectively implement the grid transformations while handling potential exceptions and validating each step to ensure accuracy."

          "To determine the exact transformation rules and required tools based on the given task analysis, let's break down the process into distinct components:\n\n### 1. Core Transformation Components:\n\n#### a. Identify Main Pattern Rules\n\n- **Object Extraction**: Identify distinct objects within the grid.\n- **Object Transformation**: Apply transformations like rotation, flipping, or color changes to each object.\n- **Object Placement**: Reposition or recombine objects in the grid.\n\n#### b. List Required Tools for Each Rule\n\n- **Object Extraction**: Use `get_objects(grid, more_info=True)` to extract objects and gather details like size and shape.\n  \n- **Transformation Tools**: Depending on the task specifics, use:\n  - `rotate_clockwise(grid, degree)` for rotation.\n  - `horizontal_flip(grid)` and `vertical_flip(grid)` for flipping.\n  - `change_object_color(obj, value)` for color transformation.\n\n- **Object Placement**: Use `fill_object(grid, obj, align)` or `combine_object(obj_1, obj_2)` for positioning and merging objects back into the grid.\n\n#### c. Explain Tool Selection Reasoning\n\n- **Object Manipulation**: Using `get_objects` allows for precise identification and manipulation of individual objects, which is critical for subsequent transformations.\n- **Transformation Functions**: Enable modifications to object orientation or appearance, which are often required in pattern tasks.\n- **Placement Functions**: Ensure objects are re-integrated into the grid correctly, maintaining the desired configuration.\n\n### 2. Exception Handling:\n\n#### a. Identify Special Cases\n\n- Overlapping Objects\n- Multicolor Objects\n- Objects at Grid Boundaries\n\n#### b. List Tools for Edge Cases\n\n- **Overlapping Objects**: Use `combine_object(obj_1, obj_2)` to handle overlaps, ensuring the desired overlay behavior.\n- **Multicolor Objects**: Utilize `get_object_color(obj)` and `change_object_color(obj, value)` for handling color-specific operations.\n- **Boundary Adjustments**: Use `tight_fit(grid)` to remove unnecessary empty space around objects.\n\n#### c. Define Exception Conditions\n\n- **Overlap**: If objects need to merge without overlap, ensure alignment before combining.\n- **Color Specificity**: If operations differ based on color, ensure accurate detection and handling of multicolor objects.\n- **Boundary Issues**: Adjust object boundaries using cropping or fitting techniques.\n\n### 3. Implementation Sequence:\n\n#### a. Order of Operations\n\n1. **Extract Objects**: Use `get_objects` to get all objects and their properties.\n2. **Transform Objects**: Apply necessary transformations (rotate, flip, color change).\n3. **Reposition/Combine Objects**: Use `fill_object` or `combine_object` to place or merge objects into the grid.\n\n#### b. Tool Dependencies\n\n- Extraction precedes transformation, as transformations are applied to identified objects.\n- Placement follows transformation, ensuring objects are modified before being repositioned.\n\n#### c. Critical Checkpoints\n\n- Ensure correct identification of objects.\n- Verify transformations are applied as intended.\n- Confirm objects are placed correctly without overlap or misalignment.\n\n### 4. Validation Steps:\n\n#### a. Input Validation Requirements\n\n- Ensure grid is non-empty and properly formatted.\n- Validate that objects are correctly identified (no missing parts).\n\n#### b. Output Verification Steps\n\n- Check that transformed objects retain their intended properties (shape, color).\n- Verify grid integrity post-transformation (no unintended modifications).\n\n#### c. Error Handling Needs\n\n- Handle cases where no objects are found or transformations cannot be applied.\n- Ensure robust error messages for unsupported operations or invalid inputs.\n\n### Specific Implementation Details:\n\n1. **Extract and Analyze Objects**:\n   ```python\n   objects = get_objects(grid, more_info=True)\n   ```\n\n2. **Apply Transformations**:\n   ```python\n   for obj in objects:\n       if some_condition:\n           obj['grid'] = rotate_clockwise(obj['grid'], 90)\n       if another_condition:\n           obj['grid'] = horizontal_flip(obj['grid'])\n       if color_condition:\n           change_object_color(obj, new_color)\n   ```\n\n3. **Reintegrate Objects**:\n   ```python\n   result_grid = empty_grid(grid_height, grid_width)\n   for obj in objects:\n       fill_object(result_grid, obj)\n   ```\n\nThis structured approach ensures each aspect of the task is addressed methodically, using the available tools to achieve the desired grid transformation."

          "To determine the exact transformation rules and required tools based on the detailed task analysis, we need to break down the task into the core components and address each section systematically. Here's a structured approach to achieve this:\n\n### Core Transformation Components\n\n1. **Identify Main Pattern Rules:**\n   - **Object Identification:** Use `get_objects()` to extract objects from the grid based on color, rows, or columns as needed.\n   - **Object Manipulation:** Tools like `rotate_clockwise()`, `horizontal_flip()`, `vertical_flip()`, and `change_object_color()` allow for transformation of identified objects.\n   - **Grid Manipulation:** Use `fill_object()`, `fill_row()`, and `fill_col()` for inserting or modifying objects within a grid.\n\n2. **Required Tools for Each Rule:**\n   - **Extraction:** `get_objects(grid, more_info=True)`\n     - Reason: To identify and gather detailed information about the objects present in the grid.\n   - **Transformation:** \n     - `rotate_clockwise()`, `horizontal_flip()`, `vertical_flip()`\n     - Reason: To manipulate the orientation of objects as per the task requirements.\n   - **Placement and Filling:**\n     - `fill_object()`, `fill_row()`, `fill_col()`\n     - Reason: To accurately position and fill objects back into the grid.\n\n3. **Tool Selection Reasoning:**\n   - Tools are selected based on their ability to perform specific transformations and manipulations directly relevant to task requirements, allowing efficient and clear operations on the grid and objects.\n\n### Exception Handling\n\n1. **Identify Special Cases:**\n   - **Overlapping Objects:** Use `combine_object()` when two objects need to be merged with overlapping areas.\n   - **Color Unavailability:** Use `object_contains_color()` to check for color presence before operations that depend on it.\n\n2. **Tools for Edge Cases:**\n   - **Object Combination:** `combine_object()`\n   - **Color Check:** `object_contains_color()`\n\n3. **Define Exception Conditions:**\n   - Ensure objects do not overlap unintentionally during transformations unless intended.\n   - Handle cases where objects span the entire grid or are positioned at grid edges.\n\n### Implementation Sequence\n\n1. **Order of Operations:**\n   - **Extract Objects:** Start by extracting all necessary objects and gather information.\n   - **Transform Objects:** Apply required transformations (rotation, flipping) to objects.\n   - **Modify Grid:** Insert transformed objects back into the grid using fill functions.\n\n2. **Tool Dependencies:**\n   - Ensure that object extraction (`get_objects()`) precedes any transformation or placement steps.\n   - Transformation tools should be applied before placement tools to ensure objects are in their final form.\n\n3. **Critical Checkpoints:**\n   - Validate object extraction results before proceeding to transformations.\n   - Confirm transformed objects fit within grid boundaries.\n\n### Validation Steps\n\n1. **Input Validation Requirements:**\n   - Ensure grid dimensions are compatible with operations.\n   - Verify that object extraction returns expected results.\n\n2. **Output Verification Steps:**\n   - After transformations, check that the modified grid matches expected output in terms of object placement and appearance.\n   - Use visual or automated checks to confirm transformations were applied correctly.\n\n3. **Error Handling Needs:**\n   - Implement checks for invalid transformations (e.g., attempting to rotate non-square objects).\n   - Handle cases where no objects are returned from extraction gracefully.\n\nIn summary, by following this structured approach, we can systematically implement the grid transformation task using the available tools, handle exceptions, and validate results effectively."

Core Transformation Components:\n\n#### A. Identify Main Pattern Rules:\n- **Object Identification:** \n  - Use `get_objects()` to extract objects from the grid. Setting `more_info=True` will provide additional details such as size, cell count, and shape.\n  \n- **Object Manipulation:** \n  - Use `rotate_clockwise()`, `horizontal_flip()`, and `vertical_flip()` to manipulate objects as per transformation rules.\n  \n- **Color Change:**\n  - Use `change_object_color()` to modify the object's color if needed.\n\n- **Object Combination:**\n  - Use `combine_object()` to merge objects, with `obj_2` overwriting `obj_1` if they overlap.\n\n#### B. Required Tools:\n- `get_objects()`: To extract and analyze objects from the grid.\n- `rotate_clockwise()`, `horizontal_flip()`, `vertical_flip()`: For object transformations.\n- `change_object_color()`: For changing object colors.\n- `combine_object()`: To merge objects if needed.\n\n#### C. Tool Selection Reasoning:\n- These tools are selected based on their ability to manipulate grid objects effectively, handle color changes, and facilitate object combination.\n\n### 2. Exception Handling:\n\n#### A. Identify Special Cases:\n- **Empty Grids or Objects:**\n  - Handle cases where no objects are detected using `get_objects()`.\n\n- **Multicolor Objects:** \n  - If multicolor objects are not supported or cause issues, ensure `multicolor=False` is set.\n\n#### B. List Tools for Edge Cases:\n- Use `empty_grid()` to handle or create grids when objects are not present.\n- Check for color presence with `object_contains_color()` to manage multicolor issues.\n\n#### C. Define Exception Conditions:\n- If `get_objects()` returns an empty list, handle this gracefully by checking the list length before proceeding with transformations.\n\n### 3. Implementation Sequence:\n\n#### A. Order of Operations:\n1. **Extract Objects:** Use `get_objects()` to identify and extract objects from the grid.\n2. **Transform Objects:** Perform transformations using `rotate_clockwise()`, `horizontal_flip()`, or `vertical_flip()`.\n3. **Change Colors:** Adjust object colors with `change_object_color()` if necessary.\n4. **Combine Objects:** Merge objects using `combine_object()` if overlapping or combining is required.\n\n#### B. Tool Dependencies:\n- Ensure `get_objects()` is called before any transformation or color change, as it is the initial step in object handling.\n\n#### C. Critical Checkpoints:\n- Verify object extraction and characteristics before proceeding with transformations.\n- Confirm object color changes before applying them to the grid.\n\n### 4. Validation Steps:\n\n#### A. Input Validation Requirements:\n- Ensure the input grid is valid and non-empty. Handle null or improperly formatted grids using `empty_grid()` if necessary.\n\n#### B. Output Verification Steps:\n- After transformations, verify the shape and orientation of objects using `get_objects()` to ensure they match expected results.\n- Confirm color changes are correctly applied using `get_object_color()`.\n\n#### C. Error Handling Needs:\n- Implement checks for empty or invalid grids and provide fallback mechanisms using `empty_grid()` or default values.\n- Use try-except blocks to catch and handle exceptions during object transformations and combinations.\n\nBy following these detailed steps, you can implement a robust solution for transforming grid objects using the provided tools. Each step ensures that all scenarios, including edge cases, are effectively addressed."

          "To determine the exact transformation rules and required tools from the task analysis, we need to break down the process into clear steps. Here's how you can approach this based on the core transformation components, exception handling, implementation sequence, and validation steps:\n\n### 1. Core Transformation Components\n\n**Identify Main Pattern Rules:**\n- **Pattern Detection:** Use tools like `get_objects` to identify and isolate objects within the grid. This can include extracting objects based on color, shape, or position.\n- **Transformation Rules:** Define what transformations are needed, such as rotation, flipping, or color changes.\n- **Reassembly Rules:** Determine how objects need to be combined or placed back onto the grid.\n\n**List Required Tools for Each Rule:**\n- **Object Extraction:** Use `get_objects` with appropriate parameters (`by_color`, `multicolor`) to gather objects for transformation.\n- **Transformation Operations:** Utilize `rotate_clockwise`, `horizontal_flip`, `vertical_flip` for rotating and flipping objects.\n- **Color Operations:** Use `change_object_color` to modify object colors as needed.\n- **Placement:** Use `fill_object`, `fill_row`, or `fill_col` to place objects back into the grid.\n\n**Explain Tool Selection Reasoning:**\n- **Extraction Tools:** `get_objects` provides a flexible way to segment the grid into manageable parts based on specific criteria.\n- **Transformation Tools:** Rotation and flipping operations are essential for reorienting objects to fit the target pattern.\n- **Placement Tools:** These are necessary to ensure objects are correctly aligned and positioned within the grid.\n\n### 2. Exception Handling\n\n**Identify Special Cases:**\n- Objects with multiple colors or complex shapes may need special handling.\n- Overlapping objects or boundary conditions might require specific attention.\n\n**List Tools for Edge Cases:**\n- **`combine_object`:** For handling overlapping objects.\n- **`tight_fit`:** To remove unnecessary space around objects for better placement.\n- **`object_contains_color`:** To check for specific color conditions before transformations.\n\n**Define Exception Conditions:**\n- If objects are multicolored but need to be treated as single color, additional logic is required.\n- Overlapping objects may need priority rules for which object takes precedence.\n\n### 3. Implementation Sequence\n\n**Order of Operations:**\n1. **Extract Objects:** Use `get_objects` to identify all relevant objects in the grid.\n2. **Transform Objects:** Apply necessary transformations like rotation or flipping.\n3. **Change Colors:** Adjust colors of objects if required.\n4. **Reassemble Grid:** Place transformed objects back into the grid using placement tools.\n\n**Tool Dependencies:**\n- **Extraction:** Must precede transformation and placement.\n- **Transformation:** Precedes reassembly, might depend on color conditions.\n- **Placement:** Final step, dependent on successful extraction and transformation.\n\n**Critical Checkpoints:**\n- Ensure objects are correctly extracted and transformed before placement.\n- Validate no undesired overlaps occur during reassembly.\n\n### 4. Validation Steps\n\n**Input Validation Requirements:**\n- Check grid dimensions and ensure they are within expected parameters.\n- Verify object extraction is successful and complete.\n\n**Output Verification Steps:**\n- Compare the final grid against expected patterns or conditions.\n- Ensure all objects are correctly oriented and placed.\n\n**Error Handling Needs:**\n- Implement checks for empty or invalid grids.\n- Handle exceptions where transformations cannot be applied or result in errors.\n\nBy following these detailed transformation rules and leveraging the specified tools effectively, you can implement a robust solution for the given task."

Core Transformation Components\n\n**Objective**: To identify patterns and transformations needed for the task.\n\n- **Pattern Identification**: Begin by analyzing the grid to identify objects, their colors, and their positions.\n  - **Tool**: `get_objects(grid, more_info=True)`\n    - **Reasoning**: This tool will help to extract objects along with detailed information like size, shape, and cell count, crucial for understanding patterns.\n\n- **Color and Position Analysis**: Determine the color distribution and positions of each object.\n  - **Tool**: `get_pixel_coords(grid)`\n    - **Reasoning**: This tool provides a comprehensive map of colors and their respective coordinates, which is useful for analyzing object distribution.\n\n- **Transformation Requirements**: Based on identified patterns, decide if transformations like rotation or flipping are needed.\n  - **Tools**: `rotate_clockwise(grid, degree)`, `horizontal_flip(grid)`, `vertical_flip(grid)`\n    - **Reasoning**: These tools will allow us to perform necessary geometrical transformations on the identified objects.\n\n### 2. Exception Handling\n\n**Objective**: To manage special cases that might disrupt normal processing.\n\n- **Special Case Identification**: Look for objects that do not fit the general pattern or have unique characteristics.\n  - **Tool**: `object_contains_color(obj, value)`\n    - **Reasoning**: Useful for identifying objects with specific colors that might need special handling.\n\n- **Edge Case Tools**:\n  - **Tool**: `tight_fit(grid)`\n    - **Reasoning**: This will handle cases where objects need to be tightly cropped for further processing.\n\n- **Exception Conditions**: Define conditions such as overlapping objects or objects with unique colors that require specific transformations or handling.\n  - **Tool**: `combine_object(obj_1, obj_2)`\n    - **Reasoning**: Allows combining objects while handling overlaps by overwriting, which might be necessary for certain edge cases.\n\n### 3. Implementation Sequence\n\n**Objective**: Establish a logical flow of operations.\n\n1. **Extract and Analyze Objects**:\n   - Use `get_objects(grid, more_info=True)` to get detailed information about each object.\n\n2. **Color and Position Mapping**:\n   - Apply `get_pixel_coords(grid)` to map out colors and their coordinates.\n\n3. **Transformation Execution**:\n   - Depending on the pattern analysis, use `rotate_clockwise`, `horizontal_flip`, or `vertical_flip` for necessary transformations.\n\n4. **Handle Exceptions**:\n   - Use `tight_fit` to crop objects and `combine_object` for overlapping scenarios.\n\n5. **Fill and Replace Operations**:\n   - Use `fill_object`, `fill_row`, or `fill_col` if additional filling operations are required based on the task specifics.\n\n### 4. Validation Steps\n\n**Objective**: Ensure the implementation meets the requirements and handles errors effectively.\n\n- **Input Validation**:\n  - Ensure the grid is not empty and objects are correctly detected using `get_objects`.\n\n- **Output Verification**:\n  - Verify the transformed grid matches expected patterns, using visual checks or automated pattern verification if possible.\n\n- **Error Handling**:\n  - Implement checks using `object_contains_color` to ensure no unexpected colors remain.\n  - Use conditional statements to manage any unexpected tool outputs or errors.\n\nBy following these detailed steps, the task can be approached methodically, ensuring all transformation rules are applied correctly, exceptions are handled, and the sequence of operations is efficiently executed with appropriate validation."

          "To provide specific and actionable implementation details, let's break down the task into its core components, exceptions, implementation sequence, and validation steps:\n\n### 1. Core Transformation Components\n\n**Identify Main Pattern Rules:**\n- Extract objects from the grid using color or shape.\n- Transform objects based on specific criteria (e.g., rotation, flipping).\n- Combine or modify objects as needed.\n\n**List Required Tools for Each Rule:**\n- **Object Extraction:** `get_objects(grid, multicolor=True)` to identify all objects, allowing for multicolored objects.\n- **Object Transformation:** Use `rotate_clockwise(grid, degree)`, `horizontal_flip(grid)`, and `vertical_flip(grid)` to apply transformations.\n- **Object Modification:** Use `change_object_color(obj, value)` if object color needs modification.\n- **Object Combination:** Use `combine_object(obj_1, obj_2)` to merge objects if necessary.\n\n**Explain Tool Selection Reasoning:**\n- `get_objects` is used because it provides comprehensive information about objects, necessary for further operations.\n- Transformation tools like `rotate_clockwise`, `horizontal_flip`, and `vertical_flip` are selected based on common transformation needs.\n- `change_object_color` and `combine_object` are selected for modifying and merging objects as required by the task rules.\n\n### 2. Exception Handling\n\n**Identify Special Cases:**\n- Objects overlapping during combination.\n- Objects extending beyond grid boundaries after transformation.\n- Multi-step transformations leading to unexpected results.\n\n**List Tools for Edge Cases:**\n- **Boundary Management:** Use `tight_fit(grid)` to handle grid boundary issues after transformation.\n- **Overlap Handling:** Use `combine_object(obj_1, obj_2)` carefully to handle overlaps, ensuring the correct object takes precedence.\n\n**Define Exception Conditions:**\n- If an object overflows the grid after transformation, crop or adjust using `crop_grid`.\n- Ensure correct object precedence during combination to avoid incorrect merging.\n\n### 3. Implementation Sequence\n\n**Order of Operations:**\n1. Extract objects using `get_objects`.\n2. Apply necessary transformations (rotation, flipping).\n3. Modify object properties if needed (e.g., color change).\n4. Combine objects if required.\n5. Insert objects back into the grid.\n\n**Tool Dependencies:**\n- Transformation tools depend on initial object extraction.\n- Combination and modification operations follow transformations.\n\n**Critical Checkpoints:**\n- Verify successful object extraction.\n- Confirm transformations are applied correctly.\n- Check object combination and insertion for accuracy.\n\n### 4. Validation Steps\n\n**Input Validation Requirements:**\n- Ensure the grid is not empty before operations.\n- Validate object presence before applying transformations.\n\n**Output Verification Steps:**\n- Check transformed grid dimensions and content.\n- Verify color and position integrity of objects post-transformation.\n\n**Error Handling Needs:**\n- Handle exceptions where transformations cause grid overflow.\n- Manage errors during object combination to prevent data loss.\n\n### Example Implementation\n\n```python\ndef transform_grid(grid):\n    # Extract objects\n    objects = get_objects(grid, multicolor=True)\n    \n    # Process each object\n    for obj in objects:\n        # Example transformation: Rotate each object 90 degrees and flip horizontally\n        obj['grid'] = rotate_clockwise(obj['grid'], 90)\n        obj['grid'] = horizontal_flip(obj['grid'])\n        \n        # Modify color if required (example: change color to 1)\n        if get_object_color(obj) != 1:\n            obj = change_object_color(obj, 1)\n        \n        # Insert transformed object back into the grid\n        grid = fill_object(grid, obj)\n    \n    return grid\n\n# Example input and usage\ninput_grid = [\n    # Define grid with objects\n]\n\ntransformed_grid = transform_grid(input_grid)\n```\n\n### Notes\n- This implementation assumes a generic transformation. Adjust transformations based on specific task requirements.\n- Consider edge cases and ensure error handling is robust to maintain grid integrity."

Here\u2019s how we can structure the implementation:\n\n### 1. Core Transformation Components\n\n#### Identify Main Pattern Rules:\n- **Pattern Extraction**: Identify distinct objects or patterns within the grid.\n- **Pattern Manipulation**: Manipulate these patterns according to specific transformation rules like rotation, flipping, or color change.\n- **Pattern Placement**: Properly place the transformed patterns back onto the grid.\n\n#### List Required Tools for Each Rule:\n- **Pattern Extraction**: Use `get_objects()` to extract components from the grid.\n- **Pattern Manipulation**: \n  - Use `rotate_clockwise()` for rotating patterns.\n  - Use `horizontal_flip()` and `vertical_flip()` for flipping patterns.\n  - Use `change_object_color()` to change the colors of objects if necessary.\n- **Pattern Placement**: \n  - Use `fill_object()` to place manipulated patterns back into the grid.\n  - Use `combine_object()` if combining multiple patterns is needed.\n\n#### Explain Tool Selection Reasoning:\n- `get_objects()` is essential to identify and separate distinct components based on the rules defined (such as by color or row).\n- `rotate_clockwise()`, `horizontal_flip()`, and `vertical_flip()` are chosen for their ability to alter object orientation, which is a common transformation task.\n- `change_object_color()` and `fill_object()` are used to ensure the manipulated object is accurately represented in its new form and position.\n\n### 2. Exception Handling\n\n#### Identify Special Cases:\n- Overlapping objects after transformation.\n- Objects that span across multiple rows or colors which might need special grouping.\n- Objects positioned at grid borders.\n\n#### List Tools for Edge Cases:\n- `combine_object()` to handle overlapping objects.\n- `crop_grid()` and `tight_fit()` for handling objects at grid borders or needing resizing.\n- `replace()` for addressing specific color pattern replacements.\n\n#### Define Exception Conditions:\n- If transformed objects overlap, ensure that the intended overlay rule (like `combine_object()`) correctly prioritizes which object should display.\n- Use `tight_fit()` to remove unnecessary empty space which might arise after transformations.\n\n### 3. Implementation Sequence\n\n#### Order of Operations:\n1. **Extract Objects**: Use `get_objects()` to identify and extract significant objects.\n2. **Transform Objects**: Apply necessary transformations using `rotate_clockwise()`, `horizontal_flip()`, etc.\n3. **Handle Exceptions**: Check and handle any overlaps or border issues.\n4. **Reintegrate Objects**: Place objects back using `fill_object()` or `combine_object()`.\n\n#### Tool Dependencies:\n- Extracted objects are dependencies for all transformation tools.\n- Proper reintegration depends on correctly transformed and possibly resized objects.\n\n#### Critical Checkpoints:\n- Ensure objects are correctly identified and extracted.\n- Verify transformations maintain object integrity and intended changes.\n- Confirm final grid reflects all transformations accurately without unintended overlaps.\n\n### 4. Validation Steps\n\n#### Input Validation Requirements:\n- Confirm grid conforms to expected format and dimensions.\n- Validate that extracted objects match expected characteristics (color, shape).\n\n#### Output Verification Steps:\n- Check grid for expected transformations.\n- Ensure all original objects are present in some transformed form.\n- Validate that no additional, unintended objects are present.\n\n#### Error Handling Needs:\n- Implement checks for empty or null grid inputs.\n- Handle unexpected exceptions during object manipulation (e.g., invalid rotations).\n\nBy following this structured approach, we can ensure a robust implementation of the transformation rules using the specified tools.

          "To determine the exact transformation rules and required tools from the task analysis, we need to methodically break down the task into components, exceptions, implementation, and validation. Here is a detailed guide:\n\n### 1. Core Transformation Components\n\n**Main Pattern Rules:**\n- **Object Identification:** Use `get_objects` to identify objects within the grid. This is crucial for any transformation involving object manipulation.\n- **Object Manipulation:** Depending on the task, you may need to rotate, flip, or combine objects using `rotate_clockwise`, `horizontal_flip`, `vertical_flip`, or `combine_object`.\n- **Grid Modification:** Tools like `fill_value`, `fill_row`, `fill_col`, `fill_between_coords`, and `fill_rect` are used to modify specific areas of the grid.\n- **Object Cropping and Tight Fitting:** Use `crop_grid` and `tight_fit` to resize or reshape objects or grids as needed.\n\n**Required Tools for Each Rule:**\n- **Object Identification:** `get_objects(grid, more_info=True)`\n- **Object Manipulation (e.g., rotate):** `rotate_clockwise(grid, degree=90)`\n- **Grid Modification (e.g., fill a rectangle):** `fill_rect(grid, tl, br, value)`\n- **Changing Object Properties:** `change_object_color(obj, value)`\n\n**Tool Selection Reasoning:**\n- Tools are selected based on the type of transformation required. For instance, if the task involves rotating an object, `rotate_clockwise` is used. If the task requires filling specific grid areas, `fill_rect` or similar tools are employed.\n\n### 2. Exception Handling\n\n**Identify Special Cases:**\n- Overlapping Objects: Require use of `combine_object`\n- Multicolor Objects: Set `multicolor=True` in `get_objects`\n- Empty Grids or Rows: Use `empty_grid` or `tight_fit`\n\n**Tools for Edge Cases:**\n- **Overlap Handling:** `combine_object(obj_1, obj_2)`\n- **Color Handling:** `get_object_color(obj)` and `change_object_color(obj, value)`\n\n**Define Exception Conditions:**\n- When objects overlap, ensure `combine_object` is used to resolve overwrites.\n- When dealing with multicolor objects, ensure all colors are managed appropriately via `multicolor=True`.\n\n### 3. Implementation Sequence\n\n**Order of Operations:**\n1. Identify objects on the grid using `get_objects`.\n2. Manipulate objects as needed (e.g., rotate, flip).\n3. Modify the grid using filling tools.\n4. Handle exceptions like overlaps or color changes.\n\n**Tool Dependencies:**\n- Ensure `get_objects` is performed before any manipulation, as it provides the object coordinates and dimensions.\n- If using `combine_object`, both objects need to be identified first.\n\n**Critical Checkpoints:**\n- Verify object identification accuracy.\n- Confirm manipulation results (e.g., correct orientation after rotation).\n- Ensure grid modifications match the desired output.\n\n### 4. Validation Steps\n\n**Input Validation Requirements:**\n- Ensure input grid dimensions are correct and within expected ranges.\n- Verify that the grid contains identifiable objects.\n\n**Output Verification Steps:**\n- Check that manipulated objects match expected positions and orientations.\n- Confirm grid modifications align with task requirements.\n\n**Error Handling Needs:**\n- Implement checks for invalid inputs (e.g., out-of-bound coordinates).\n- Handle exceptions for unresolvable overlaps or color mismatches.\n\n### Implementation Details\n1. **Object Identification:**\n   ```python\n   objects = get_objects(grid, more_info=True)\n   ```\n\n2. **Object Manipulation (e.g., Rotate):**\n   ```python\n   rotated_object = rotate_clockwise(objects[0]['grid'], degree=90)\n   ```\n\n3. **Grid Modification (e.g., Fill Rectangle):**\n   ```python\n   fill_rect(grid, (0, 0), (2, 2), value=1)\n   ```\n\n4. **Exception Handling (e.g., Combine Objects):**\n   ```python\n   combined_object = combine_object(objects[0], objects[1])\n   ```\n\n5. **Validation:**\n   - Ensure output grid matches expected characteristics after each transformation step.\n\nThis detailed plan should provide a clear path to implementing the transformations with the provided tools."

Core Transformation Components:\n\n#### Identify Main Pattern Rules:\n- **Object Detection**: Identify distinct objects within a grid based on certain parameters like color, shape, or position.\n- **Transformation**: Apply transformations such as rotation, flipping, or color changes to detected objects.\n- **Placement**: Determine how transformed objects are placed back into the grid or a new grid.\n\n#### List Required Tools for Each Rule:\n- **Object Detection**: Use `get_objects()` to detect objects based on various criteria.\n- **Transformation**:\n  - `rotate_clockwise()` for rotating objects.\n  - `horizontal_flip()` or `vertical_flip()` for flipping objects.\n  - `change_object_color()` for changing the color of objects.\n- **Placement**:\n  - `fill_object()` to place objects back into a grid.\n  - `combine_object()` if multiple objects need to be merged.\n\n#### Explain Tool Selection Reasoning:\n- `get_objects()` is used to extract objects because it provides detailed information about each object, which is crucial for subsequent transformations.\n- Transformation tools are selected based on the specific operations needed for the task (e.g., rotation, flipping).\n- Placement tools ensure the transformed objects are correctly integrated into the grid.\n\n### 2. Exception Handling:\n\n#### Identify Special Cases:\n- Objects may overlap after transformation.\n- Grid size constraints when placing transformed objects.\n\n#### List Tools for Edge Cases:\n- `combine_object()` to handle overlapping objects.\n- `tight_fit()` to remove unnecessary empty space when needed.\n\n#### Define Exception Conditions:\n- Ensure `combine_object()` is used where objects overlap.\n- Use `tight_fit()` to adjust grid size if the transformed object exceeds current grid boundaries.\n\n### 3. Implementation Sequence:\n\n#### Order of Operations:\n1. **Detect Objects**: Use `get_objects()` to retrieve objects with relevant parameters set.\n2. **Transform Objects**: Apply necessary transformations like rotation or color change.\n3. **Place Objects**: Use `fill_object()` or `combine_object()` to place objects into the grid.\n\n#### Tool Dependencies:\n- Transformation tools depend on correct object detection.\n- Placement depends on correctly transformed objects.\n\n#### Critical Checkpoints:\n- Verify correct object detection before transformation.\n- Check for correct positioning and non-overlapping placement.\n\n### 4. Validation Steps:\n\n#### Input Validation Requirements:\n- Ensure grid input is valid and non-empty.\n- Confirm object extraction parameters are set correctly.\n\n#### Output Verification Steps:\n- Verify that transformed objects retain intended properties (shape, color).\n- Ensure the final grid structure is correct and meets task requirements (no unintended overlaps).\n\n#### Error Handling Needs:\n- Handle cases where object transformation fails (e.g., invalid rotation degree).\n- Ensure grid size is adjusted if necessary to fit transformed objects.\n\n### Specific Implementation Details:\n\n1. **Object Detection**:\n   ```python\n   objects = get_objects(grid, multicolor=True, more_info=True)\n   ```\n\n2. **Transformation**:\n   ```python\n   for obj in objects:\n       # Example: Rotate object by 90 degrees\n       obj['grid'] = rotate_clockwise(obj['grid'], degree=90)\n       # Change object color, if needed\n       obj = change_object_color(obj, new_color)\n   ```\n\n3. **Placement**:\n   ```python\n   result_grid = empty_grid(target_row, target_col)\n   for obj in objects:\n       fill_object(result_grid, obj)\n   ```\n\n4. **Exception Handling**:\n   ```python\n   for i, obj1 in enumerate(objects):\n       for obj2 in objects[i+1:]:\n           if objects_overlap(obj1, obj2):\n               combined_obj = combine_object(obj1, obj2)\n               fill_object(result_grid, combined_obj)\n   ```\n\nBy following the above detailed steps, you can implement the transformation rules and handle any exceptions effectively using the provided tools."

Here's a detailed breakdown of each step:\n\n### 1. Core Transformation Components\n\n**Identify Main Pattern Rules:**\n- **Object Identification:** Use `get_objects` to detect distinct objects in the grid. Consider parameters like `by_row`, `by_col`, or `by_color` depending on how objects are defined in the task.\n- **Object Manipulation:** Depending on the transformation, you might need to rotate, flip, or change the color of the objects using tools like `rotate_clockwise`, `horizontal_flip`, `vertical_flip`, and `change_object_color`.\n- **Grid Manipulation:** Tools such as `fill_row`, `fill_col`, `fill_rect`, and `replace` are used for specific grid changes.\n\n**List Required Tools for Each Rule:**\n- **Object Detection:** `get_objects(grid, more_info=True)`\n- **Pixel Analysis:** `get_pixel_coords(grid)`\n- **Grid Modification:** `fill_row`, `fill_col`, `fill_rect`, `replace`\n- **Object Transformation:** `rotate_clockwise`, `horizontal_flip`, `vertical_flip`, `change_object_color`\n\n**Explain Tool Selection Reasoning:**\n- **`get_objects`:** Essential for detecting and manipulating distinct elements within the grid.\n- **`rotate_clockwise`, `horizontal_flip`, `vertical_flip`:** Needed for changing the orientation of objects as per the transformation rules.\n- **`fill_row`, `fill_col`, `fill_rect`:** Useful for filling specific areas of the grid with a certain value.\n- **`replace`:** Allows for substitutions within the grid, useful for replacing patterns.\n\n### 2. Exception Handling\n\n**Identify Special Cases:**\n- Objects with overlapping regions or objects containing specific colors that need special handling.\n- Edge cases where objects are located at the boundary of the grid.\n\n**List Tools for Edge Cases:**\n- **Overlap Handling:** `combine_object` to manage overlapping objects.\n- **Boundary Management:** `crop_grid` and `tight_fit` to adjust grid size and focus on specific sections.\n\n**Define Exception Conditions:**\n- If objects overlap and specific rules govern which object takes precedence.\n- If objects need to be extracted or modified based on their color or position.\n\n### 3. Implementation Sequence\n\n**Order of Operations:**\n1. **Object Detection:** Use `get_objects` to identify all relevant objects.\n2. **Analyze and Modify Objects:** Use `get_pixel_coords` to analyze pixel distribution and tools like `rotate_clockwise`, `horizontal_flip` for modifications.\n3. **Grid Modifications:** Apply `fill_row`, `fill_col`, `fill_rect`, or `replace` based on the rules.\n4. **Exception Handling:** Use `combine_object` and `crop_grid` to handle edge cases.\n\n**Tool Dependencies:**\n- Most tools depend on the initial object detection (`get_objects`). Ensure this is done first.\n\n**Critical Checkpoints:**\n- Verify object detection is accurate and complete.\n- Ensure transformations are applied correctly and in the correct order.\n\n### 4. Validation Steps\n\n**Input Validation Requirements:**\n- Ensure the grid is in the expected format and contains valid pixel values.\n- Validate that the parameters for tools (e.g., coordinates, colors) are correct.\n\n**Output Verification Steps:**\n- Confirm the final grid meets the specified transformation requirements.\n- Check that no unintended changes to the grid have occurred.\n\n**Error Handling Needs:**\n- Implement error checks for invalid operations, such as out-of-bound access or illegal transformations.\n- Use try-except blocks to catch and handle exceptions gracefully where applicable.\n\nBy following this structured approach, you can effectively determine and apply the transformation rules using the available tools."
