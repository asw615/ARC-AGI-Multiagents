The task consistently takes the input pattern and expands it into a larger grid with a structured, alternating pattern of '1's and '2's, while maintaining the same general layout and position of the original '5' pattern within the larger grid.\n\npixel_changes:\n- The '5' values in the input grid are replaced by '1' and '2' in the output grid, following an alternating pattern.\n- The '0' values in the input grid correspond to '0' values in the output grid, except where they are replaced by the alternating pattern.\n- The alternating pattern of '1' and '2' begins from the top left corner of the section where '5's are present in the input grid and extends outwards within the new 6x6 grid.\n\nobject_changes:\n- The input object, represented by '5's, is transformed into a larger 6x6 grid.\n- The original object is expanded into a full 6x6 grid with an alternating pattern, preserving the relative positioning of the '5's.\n- The output grid introduces a systematic pattern ('1' and '2'), replacing the original '5's while filling the grid to a 6x6 size, maintaining a consistent visual pattern across examples."
