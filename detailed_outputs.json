For the input grid of size 2x2, the output should be a 6x6 grid with a specific repeating pattern.\n\n### Breakdown of the Patterns:\n1. The input consists of two rows and two columns.\n2.

          "To solve the puzzle, I analyzed the training examples to identify the underlying logic and transformations that convert the input grids into their corresponding output grids.\n\n### Observations:\n1. **Structure of the Input and Output**: The output grids are structured such that each row in the output grid is a repetition of the same values, indicating a transformation applied uniformly across the rows.\n\n2. **Value Mapping**: The transformation appears to depend on the arrangement and presence of the number '5' in the input grid. In each output, distinct regions corresponding to the clusters of '5's in the input are assigned specific output values.\n\n3. **Mapping Patterns**:\n   - In Example 1, the clusters of '5's are mapped to `3` and `4`, while `0s` are mapped to `9`.\n   - In Example 2, `5` appears to define a boundary that maps to different values (`9` for regions with more `0`s and `1` for fewer `5`s).\n   - In Example 3, the dominant `5`s lead to `6` for the first column and `3` in the middle.\n   - In Example 4, the mapping is similar, where the presence of `5` in rows affects the assignment of numbers.\n\n4. **Output Value Groups**: The outputs can be grouped based on the patterns formed by the number `5`:\n   - Regions dominated by `5` are assigned higher numbers (like `6` or `9`).\n   - Areas with less or no `5` seem to receive lower numbers (like `1`, `3`, `4`).\n\n### Logic Summary:\n- The transformation is likely based on the density and arrangement of the number `5` in the input grid. \n- Regions with higher concentrations of `5` correspond to higher output values, while isolated or absent `5`s result in lower output values.\n- Each row in the output reflects a uniform mapping of values based on the clusters of `5`s detected in the input, creating a consistent pattern across rows.\n\n### Test Case Prediction:\nFor the provided test input:\n```\n[\n[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5],\n[0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n[5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n]\n```\n- The first row contains a cluster of `5`s toward the right, suggesting a higher output value.\n- The second row contains `5`s in the middle and fewer `0`s, suggesting a lower output value.\n- The third row contains a strong presence of `5`s across the entire row.\n\n### Predicted Output:\nBased on the mapping observed, the predicted output would likely be:\n```\n[\n[4, 4, 4, 6, 6, 6, 9, 9, 9],\n[4, 4, 4, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1],\n[6, 6, 6, 6, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1],\n]\n```\n- Here, `4` corresponds to the `0s` in rows where `5`s are absent or sparse, and `6` corresponds to regions with dense `5`s.",

The non-zero numbers tend to be replaced by a specific value based on their context in the grid. \n\n### Key Observations:\n1. The number `5` appears to be a key value in the grid, specifically in the right half of the input grid. \n2. The transformation generally involves replacing `5` with another number based on the arrangement and density of `5`s nearby.\n3. The output grids are often homogenously filled in sections, suggesting that contiguous areas of the same number are replaced by a uniform number.\n\n### Summary of Required Transformations:\n1. **Identify Non-Zero Pixels**: We need to find the coordinates of the cells containing the number `5`.\n2. **Define Replacement Values**: Based on previous examples, `5` appears to have a corresponding replacement value. We will need to determine what that value would be for this specific arrangement.\n3. **Fill or Replace**: Use `fill_grid` or `replace` to transform the identified sections of the grid based on the patterns observed in the previous examples.\n\n### Possible Transformations:\n- Non-zero areas (specifically `5`s) could be replaced by a specific value (let\u2019s assume it\u2019s `3`, based on the patterns from previous examples).\n- Other areas (the `0`s) might need to follow a similar filling strategy to match the expected output in terms of homogeneous sections.\n\n### Suggested Tools for the Task:\n1. **get_pixel_coords**: To locate the positions of all non-zero pixels (specifically those containing `5`).\n2. **replace**: To swap out the found `5`s with their corresponding output values.\n3. **fill_grid**: To fill in areas with a specific pattern or value after determining what to replace.\n\n### Next Steps:\n1. Use `get_pixel_coords` to gather non-zero pixel locations in the grid.\n2. Analyze the gathered coordinates to determine the most logical values to replace the `5`s based on their groupings.\n3. Implement the replacement using `replace` or `fill_grid` as necessary to achieve uniform output.\n\nThis systematic approach will help in transforming the input grid into the desired output format while adhering to the patterns established in previous examples."
