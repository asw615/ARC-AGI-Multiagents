The chosen color from the third non-zero row is placed at the central position of the row of zeros. For example:\n- In Example 1, the '2' from the third row is moved to position (2, 1).\n- In Example 2, the '4' from the third row is moved to position (3, 2).\n- In Example 3, the '1' from the third row is moved to position (6, 3).\n\nobject_changes: The object change involves moving a single instance of the color from the third row of uniform color to the corresponding middle position in the zero row directly beneath it.
