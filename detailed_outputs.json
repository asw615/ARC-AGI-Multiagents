The pattern observed in the examples suggests that the input grid is extended by alternating rows and columns with a mirrored pattern.\n\npixel_changes: Each pixel in the 2x2 input grid is used to create a 3x3 repetition pattern in the output grid. The pixels in the output alternate in both horizontal and vertical directions based on the initial 2x2 pattern. Specifically, the pixels are repeated in two directions: horizontally across each row and vertically down each column, maintaining a mirrored pattern.\n\nobject_changes: The input object, which is a 2x2 grid, is expanded to a 6x6 grid by repeating and alternating the original pattern. This involves increasing both the number of rows and columns, resulting in a grid that is three times larger in each dimension. The values themselves do not change, but their positions are alternated according to the observed pattern to fill the new grid. The original shape and values are preserved but extended to form the larger grid through systematic repetition."

Since the transformation involves converting specific patterns (like clusters of numbers) to another form, this tool can be crucial in identifying those patterns.\n\n2. **obj_to_coords**: Once objects are identified, this tool can be used to get their coordinates, which is useful for understanding their layout and position in the grid.\n\n3. **create_object**: This tool can be used to create new objects based on the patterns identified in the input grid.

          "Reflection:\n- The task involves identifying a pattern where the input grid contains a single non-zero number, and the output grid is a larger grid where this number is surrounded by the same number, creating a border around it.\n- The non-zero number in the input is at the center of the grid, and in the output, it remains at the center with additional rows and columns added to form a border.\n- The predicted grid size for the given test input will be larger than the input grid, specifically adding a border of one cell thickness around the non-zero number.\n\nPixel Changes:\n- The central non-zero number in the input remains in the output, but it is now surrounded by a border of the same number.\n- The border is one cell thick, extending the grid dimensions by adding one row and one column on each side of the original grid.\n- All original zeroes in the input become part of the border, except for the position of the non-zero number.\n\nObject Changes:\n- The input grid contains a single object, which is the non-zero number, centrally located.\n- In the output, this object remains unchanged in its central position but is expanded into a larger object that includes a border of the same number.\n- The size of the grid increases, adding two rows (one on top, one at the bottom) and two columns (one on the left, one on the right).\n- The shape transforms from a single cell to a larger square grid with the central cell still containing the original non-zero number.\n- The value of the object (the non-zero number) does not change, but its presence is expanded to form a border.\n\nFor the test input, applying the identified pattern:\n- The non-zero number '8' at position (4, 3) will produce an output grid of size 7x9 (5 rows with additional borders on top and bottom, and the same 7 columns with additional borders on left and right).\n- The entire grid will have '8' as a border with the center row and column matching the position of the original '8'."

          "To solve the task described in the examples, we need to identify the object (the non-zero number) in the grid and then create a border around it while preserving the object's original position. Here are the tools that would be relevant for this task:\n\n1. **get_objects_basic**: This tool can be used to identify and extract the object (the non-zero number) from the grid.\n\n2. **get_pixel_coords**: This tool can help in determining the coordinates of the non-zero number, which is crucial for defining the area to be filled with the border.\n\n3. **fill_value**: This tool can fill specific areas or patterns with a value, which is necessary for creating the border around the object.\n\n4. **create_object**: This tool can be used to create the structure of the new grid with the border included.\n\n5. **fill_row** and **fill_col**: These tools can be used to fill entire rows and columns with the border value, which is part of the task requirement.\n\nThese tools together can help identify the non-zero pixel, determine its location, and fill the surrounding area to form a border as described in the examples."
