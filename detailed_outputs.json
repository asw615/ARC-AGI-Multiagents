The placement of this number seems to follow a diagonal pattern from the first occurrence of '5' in the grid.\n\npixel_changes: In each example, a single pixel with the value '5' is moved from an active row to a blank cell in the bottom-most row.

This change does not alter any other pixels in the grid; only one pixel is added to the blank rows.\n\nobject_changes: The object in question is the number '5', which appears as a continuous horizontal line in the row just above the blank rows. There is no change in the size or shape of this object. However, a single instance of '5' is added to the grid, specifically in a blank cell located diagonally downward from its initial position.

The output grid also involves a transformation that reduces the size of the grid to a 3x5 pattern, suggesting a standardization or compression logic that focuses on specific rows and columns.\n\npixel_changes: The primary change is the replacement of the color '9' with the color '6' in the output grid. Additionally, the output grid is smaller, consistently being 3 rows in height and 5 columns in width, while the input grid is 6 rows in height and 5 columns in width. The transformation involves selecting specific rows from the input and modifying their contents.\n\nobject_changes: In each example, the input grid contains two distinct color patterns, primarily '9' and '4'. The transformation focuses on extracting and modifying the pattern involving the color '9'. The '9' patterns are relocated and transformed into '6', while the '4' patterns are ignored in the output. The output grid's objects reflect a standardized compressed version of the input's '9' pattern, maintaining a 3x5 structure and replacing all '9' cells with '6'.\n\nGiven the test input, the predicted output will be:\n[\n[6, 6, 0, 0, 0],\n[0, 0, 6, 6, 0],\n[0, 6, 6, 0, 0],\n]"

The transformation seems to be based on moving or extracting certain patterns from the input grid to form the output grid. The main focus is on the '9' and '4' patterns in the input grid, which are somehow modified to form the '6' patterns in the output grid. It appears that the '9' patterns are being transformed to '6', while the '4' patterns are either ignored or play a minimal role in the output formation. The patterns exhibit movement and reorganization, suggesting that the transformation relies on detecting clusters of '9's and repositioning them.\n\n**Pixel Changes:**\n\n- The '9' pixels from the input are transformed into '6' in the output.\n- The '4' pixels are not directly represented in the output.\n- The transformation involves selecting certain '9' pixels to form new clusters of '6' in the output.\n- Blank pixels ('0') remain blank in the output, but their configuration may change based on the clustering of '6' pixels.\n\n**Object Changes:**\n\n- The '9' objects (clusters of '9' in the input) are converted into '6' objects in the output. \n- The position of these objects is altered, indicating a reorganization of the clusters.\n- Each '6' object in the output is a restructured form of the '9' object from the input.\n- The number of '6' objects corresponds to the number of '9' clusters considered for transformation.\n- The size and shape of objects are adjusted to fit into the smaller 3x5 output grid.\n- The '4' clusters are not present in the output, suggesting that they are not essential for the transformation to '6' or are not transformed at all."

The '8's are repositioned to form a specific pattern in the output grid: a cross shape with '8's in the first and last row, and the first and last column, with the center row entirely '0's. Essentially, the '8's are condensed into a more structured pattern.\n\nobject_changes: The input grid, which contains clusters of '8's, is transformed into an object with a precise layout in the output grid. The number of '8's remains the same, but they are rearranged into a cross-like shape. The transformation does not change the value of the objects but focuses on their spatial arrangement. The shape changes from scattered clusters to a fixed cross pattern, with the output grid consistently being 5x5 in size."

The grid size of the output matches the input grid size, but the central object is transformed into a surrounded pattern.\n\npixel_changes:\n- The non-zero pixel in the input becomes the center of a larger pattern in the output.\n- The non-zero pixel's value is used to create a border around it, filling the perimeter of the grid with the same value.\n- The pixel directly at the original non-zero position is changed to zero in the output, creating an empty space surrounded by the value's border.\n\nobject_changes:\n- The single non-zero object in the input is expanded into a larger pattern in the output.\n- The original single-pixel object turns into a larger square or rectangular shape.\n- The object's value remains the same but is used to fill a border around a central empty space.\n- The original object's position determines the center of the new pattern, but the overall shape fills the entire grid.\n- The output grid maintains the same dimensions as the input grid, but the pattern structure changes significantly.\n\nFor the test case, the predicted grid size is 9x7 (not 7x9 as initially stated in your request).
