          "reflection: The task involves analyzing the input grids and mapping them to their output grids. The observed pattern suggests that the output grids are organized based on the arrangement and replacement of colors (represented by numbers) in the input grids. Each input grid appears to be transformed into a new grid through a consistent logic, where certain colors are replaced with others based on their positions and relationships to one another. The predicted grid size of 9x3 indicates a wide yet shallow structure, allowing for multiple colors to be organized closely.\n\npixel_changes: The pixel changes reflect a systematic transformation of the input colors into specific outputs. Certain colors in the input seem to be replaced by a consistent color in the output, with a clear pattern where colors are grouped to form larger blocks. The arrangement shifts from the original pattern to a structured repetition of specific colors that are aligned in a more uniform way.\n\nobject_changes: The object changes indicate a significant transformation between the input and output grids. The number of distinct colors in the output grids is increased, with certain colors being enlarged or repeated to fill the new grid structure. The shape of the object changes as the original colors are organized into larger, cohesive sections, maintaining a tight fit that minimizes empty cells. The position of the colors also shifts, aligning them to create a new visual hierarchy, while the values assigned to each color change to represent a new identity within the output. Overall, the cell count remains consistent as the transformation focuses on rearranging rather than adding new elements."
